<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Bayeux, in Normandy, it
is said that there still lingers a superstition which
most probably came there originally in the same ship
as Rollo the Walker. The country folks believe in
the existence of a sprite (goubelin) who plagues
mankind in various ways. His most favourite
method of annoyance is to stand like a horse
saddled and bridled by the roadside, inviting the
passers-by to mount him. But woe to the unlucky
wight who yields to the temptation, for
off he sets&mdash;“Halloo! halloo! and hark away!”
galloping fearfully over stock and stone, and not
unfrequently ends by leaving his rider in a bog or
horse-pond, at the same time vanishing with a
loud peal of mocking laughter. “A heathenish and
gross superstition!” exclaims friend Broadbrim.
But what if we try to extract a jewel out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
ugly monster; knock some commonsense out of his
head. Goethe turned the old fancy of <i>Der getreue
Eckart</i> to good account in that way. What if a
moral of various application underlies this grotesque
legend. Suppose, for the nonce, that the
rider typify the writer of a book. Unable to resist
a strong temptation to bestride the Pegasus of his
imagination&mdash;whether prose or verse&mdash;he ventures
to mount and go forth into the world, and not
seldom he gets a fall for his pains amid a loud
chorus of scoffs and jeers. Indeed, this is so common
a catastrophe, from the days of Bellerophon
downwards (everybody knows that he was the
author of the <i>Letters</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that go by his name), so
prone is inkshed to lead to disaster, that the
ancient wish, “Oh that mine adversary had written
a book,” in its usual acceptation (which entirely
rests, be it said, on a faulty interpretation of the
original language), was really exceedingly natural,
as the fulfilment of it was as likely as not to lead
to the fullest gratification of human malice.</p>

<p>In defiance, however, of the dangers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
threatened him, the writer of these lines did once
gratify his whim, and mount the goblin steed, and
as good luck would have it, without being spilled
or dragged through a horse-pond, or any mischance
whatsoever. In other words, instead of cold water
being thrown upon his endeavours, <i>The Oxonian
in Norway</i> met with so indulgent a handling from
that amiable abstraction, the “Benevolus Lector,”
that it soon reached a second edition.</p>

<p>So far the author’s lucky star was in the ascendant.
But behold his infatuation, he must again
mount and tempt his fate, “Ay! and on the same
steed, too,” cries Mr. Bowbells, to whom the swarming
sound of life with an occasional whiff of the
sewers is meat, and drink, and all things; who is
bored to death if he sees more of the quiet country
than Brighton or Ramsgate presents, and is about
as locomotive in his tastes as a London sparrow.</p>

<p>“Norway again, forsooth&mdash;<i>nous revenons à nos
moutons</i>&mdash;that horrid bleak country, where the cold
in winter is so intense that when you sneeze, the
shower from your olfactories rattles against the
earth like dust-shot, and in summer you can’t sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
for the brazen-faced sun staring at you all the
twenty-four hours. What rant that is about</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The dark tall pines that plume the craggy ledge,</div>
<div class="verse">High over the blue gorge,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and all that sort of thing. Give me Kensington
Gardens and Rotten Row!”</p>

<p>Still&mdash;in spite of Bowbells&mdash;we shall venture on
the expedition, and probably with less chance of a
fiasco than if we travelled by the express-train
through the beaten paths of central Europe. There,
all is a dead level. Civilization has smoothed the
gradients actually and metaphorically&mdash;alike in the
Brunellesque and social sense. As people progress
in civilization, the more prominent marks
of national character are planed off. Individuality
is lost. The members of civilized society
are as like one another as the counters on a draft-board.
“They rub each other’s angles down,” and
thus lose “the picturesque of man and man.” The
same type keeps repeating itself with sickening
monotony, like the patterns of paper-hangings,
instead of those delightfully varied arabesques
with which the free hand of the painter used
to diversify the walls of the antique dwelling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is not so with the population of a primitive
country like Norway. Much of the simplicity
that characterized our forefathers is still
existing there. We are Aladdined to the England
of three centuries ago. Do you mean to say that
you, a sensible man or woman, prefer putting on
company manners at every turn, being everlastingly
swaddled in the artificial restraints of society;
being always among grand people, or genteel people,
or superior people, or people of awful respectability?
Do you prefer an aviary full of highly
educated song-birds mewed up so closely that they
“show off” one against another, filled with petty
rivalries and jealousies, to the gay, untutored
melody of the woods poured forth for a bird’s own
gratification or that of its mate? Do you like to
spend your time for ever in trim gardens, among
standards and espaliers, and spruce flower-beds,
so weeded, and raked, and drilled, and shaped,
that you feel positively afraid of looking and
walking about for fear of making a <i>faux pas</i>?
Oh no! you would like to see a bit of wild rose
or native heather. (Interpret this as you list of
the flowers of the field, or a fairer flower still.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
You prefer climbing a real lichened rock <i>in situ</i>,
that has not been placed there by Capability Brown
or Sir Joseph Paxton.</p>

<p>Indeed, the avidity with which books of travel in
primitive countries&mdash;whether in the tropics or
under the pole&mdash;are now read, shows that the more
refined a community is, the greater interest it will
take in the occupation, the sentiments, the manners
of people still in a primitive state of existence.
Our very over-civilization begets in us a taste to
beguile oneself of its tedium, its frivolities, its unreality,
by mixing in thought, at least, with those who
are nearer the state in which nature first made man.</p>

<p>“The manners of a rude people are always
founded on fact,” said Sir Walter Scott, “and
therefore the feelings of a polished generation immediately
sympathize with them.” It is this kind
of feeling that has a good deal to do with urging
men, who have been educated in all the habits and
comforts of improved society, to leave the groove,
and carve out for themselves a rough path through
dangers and privations in wilder countries.</p>

<p>“You will have none of this sort of thing,” said
Dr. Livingstone, in the Sheldonian theatre, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
addressing Young Oxford on the fine field for
manly, and useful, and Christian enterprise that
Africa opens out,&mdash;“You will have none of this
sort of thing there,” while he uneasily shook the
heavy sleeve of his scarlet D.C.L. gown, which he
had donned in deference to those who had conferred
on him this mark of honour. Yes, less comforts,
perhaps, but at the same time less red tape.</p>

<p>“Brown exercise” is better than the stewy, stuffy
adipocere state of frame in which the man of
“indoors mind” ultimately eventuates. Living on
frugal fare, in the sharp, brisk air of the mountain,
the lungs of mind and body expand healthfully, and
the fire of humanity burns brighter, like the fire
in the grate when fanned by a draught of fresh
oxygen. Most countries, when we visit them for
the first time, turn out “the dwarfs of presage.”
Not so Norway. It grows upon you every time
you see it. You need not fear, gentle reader, of
being taken over beaten ground. “The Oxonian”
has never visited Thelemarken and Sætersdal before.
So come along with me, in the absence of a better
guide, if you wish to cultivate a nearer acquaintance
with the roughly forged, “hardware” sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
people of this district, content to forget for a while
the eternal willow-pattern crockery of home. Thelemarken
is the most primitive part of Norway; it
is the real <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the ancients; the
very name indicates this, and the Norwegian
antiquaries quote our own King Alfred in support
of this idea. It is true, that on nearer inspection,
its physical geography will not be found to
partake of the marvellous peculiarities assigned
to Thule by the ancient Greek navigator,
Pytheas, who asserts that it possessed neither earth,
air, or sea, but a chaotic mixture of all three elements.
But that may emphatically be said to be
neither here nor there. Inaccessible the country
certainly is, and it is this very inaccessibility which
has kept out the schoolmaster; so that old times
are not yet changed, nor old manners gone, nor
the old language unlearned under the auspices of
that orthoepic functionary. The fantastic pillars
and arches of fairy folk-lore may still be descried
in the deep secluded glens of Thelemarken, undefaced
with stucco, not propped by unsightly
modern buttress. The harp of popular minstrelsy&mdash;though
it hangs mouldering and mildewed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
infrequency of use, its strings unbraced for want
of cunning hands that can tune and strike them as
the Scalds of Eld&mdash;may still now and then be heard
sending forth its simple music. Sometimes this
assumes the shape of a soothing lullaby to the
sleeping babe, or an artless ballad of love-lorn
swains, or an arch satire on rustic doings and
foibles. Sometimes it swells into a symphony
descriptive of the descent of Odin; or, in somewhat
of less Pindaric, and more Dibdin strain, it
recounts the deeds of the rollicking, death-despising
Vikings; while, anon, its numbers rise and fall
with mysterious cadence as it strives to give a
local habitation and a name to the dimly seen
forms and antic pranks of the hollow-backed Huldra
crew.</p>

<p>The author thinks that no apology is needed for
working in some of the legendary interludes which
the natives repeated to him, so curious and interesting,
most of which he believes never appeared
before in an English dress, and several of them in
no print whatever. Legends are an article much
in request just now; neither can they be considered
trifling when viewed in the light thrown upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
origin of this branch of popular belief and pastime
by the foremost men of their time, <i>e.g.</i>, Scott, and
more especially Jacob Grimm. Frivolous, indeed!
not half so frivolous as the hollow-hearted, false-fronted
absurdities of the “great and small vulgar,”
is the hollow-backed elf, with the grand mythological
background reaching into the twilight of the
earth’s history, nor so trifling the simple outspoken
peasant, grave, yet cheery, who speaks as he thinks,
and actually sometimes laughs a good guffaw, as
the stuck-up ladies and gentlemen of a section of
the artificial world, with their heartless glitter, crocodile
tears, their solemn pretence, their sham raptures.</p>

<p>I must not omit to say that the admirable troll-drawing,
which forms the frontispiece of the first
volume, is one selected from a set of similar
sketches by my friend, T. G. Jackson, Esq., of
Wadham College, Oxford. It evinces such an
intimate acquaintance with the looks of those
small gentry that it is lucky for him that he did
not live in the days when warlocks were done to
death.</p>

<p>A strange attraction has Norway for one who has
once become acquainted with it: with its weird
rocks and mountains&mdash;its dark cavernous fjords&mdash;its
transparent skies&mdash;its quaint gulf-stream warming
apparatus&mdash;its “Borealis race”&mdash;its fabulous
Maelstrom&mdash;its “Leviathan slumbering on the
Norway foam”&mdash;its sagas, so graphically portraying
the manners and thoughts of an ancient race&mdash;its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
sturdy population, descendants of that northern
hive which poured from the frozen loins of the north,
and, as Montesquieu says, “left their native climes
to destroy tyrants and slaves, and were, a thousand
years ago, the upholders of European liberty.”</p>

<p>“Very attractive, no doubt,” interrupts Piscator.
“In short, the country beats that loadstone island
in the East hollow, which extracted the bolts out
of the ships’ bottoms; drawing the tin out of one’s
pockets, and oneself thither every summer without
the possibility of resistance. But a truce to your
dithyrambs on scenery, and sagas, and liberty.
Talk about the salmon-fishing. I suppose you’re
coming to that last&mdash;the best at the end, like the
postscript of a young lady’s letter.”</p>

<p>Well, then, the salmon-fishing. A man who
has once enjoyed the thrill of <i>that</i> won’t so easily
forget it. Here, for instance, is the month of June
approaching. Observe the antics of that “old
Norwegian,” the Rev. Christian Muscular, who has
taken a College living, and become a sober family
man. See how he snorts and tosses up his head,
like an old hunter in a paddock as the chase sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
by. He keeps writing to his friends, inquiring
what salmon rivers are to be let, and what time
they start, and all that sort of thing, although he
knows perfectly well he can’t possibly go; not even
if he might have the priest’s water on the Namsen.
But no wonder Mr. Muscular is growing uneasy. The
air of Tadpole-in-the-Marsh becomes unhealthy at
that season, and he feels quite suffocated in the
house, and prostrated by repose; and as he reads
Schiller’s fresh ‘Berglied,’ he sighs for the mountain
air and the music of the gurgling river.</p>

<p>But there are mamma and the pledges; so he
must resign all hope of visiting his old haunts.
Instead of going there himself, in body, he must do
it in spirit&mdash;by reading, for instance, these pages
about the country, pretty much in the same way as
the Irish peasant children, who couldn’t get a taste
of the bacon, pointed their potatoes at it, and had a
taste in imagination. Behold, then, Mr. Muscular,
with all the family party, and the band-boxes and
bonnet-boxes, and umbrellas and parasols numbered
up to twenty; and last, not least, the dog “Ole”
(he delights to call the live things about him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Norsk names), bound for the little watering-place
of Lobster-cum-Crab. Behold him at the “Great
Babel junction,” not far from his destination, trying
to collect his scattered thoughts&mdash;which are
far away&mdash;and to do the same by his luggage, two
articles of which&mdash;Harold’s rocking-horse and Sigfrid’s
pap-bottle&mdash;are lost already. Shall I tell
you what Mr. Muscular is thinking of? Of “the
Long,” when he shut up shop without a single care;
feeling satisfied that his rooms and properties would
be in the same place when he came back, without
being entrusted to servants who gave “swarries”
above-stairs during his absence.</p>

<p>Leaving him, then, to dredge for the marine monstrosities
which abound at Lobster-cum-Crab, or
to catch congers and sea-perch at the sunken wreck
in the Bay&mdash;we shall start with our one wooden box,
and various other useful articles, for the land of the
mountain and the flood&mdash;pick up its wild legends
and wild flowers, scale its mountains, revel in the
desolation of its snowfields, thread its sequestered
valleys&mdash;catching fish and shooting fowl as occasion
offers; though we give fair notice that on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
occasion we shall bestow less attention on the wild
sports than on other matters.</p>

<p>On board the steamer that bore us away over a
sea as smooth as a mirror, was a stout English lady,
provided with a brown wig, and who used the
dredging-box most unsparingly to stop up the gaps
in her complexion.</p>

<p>“A wild country is Norway, isn’t it?” inquired
she, with a sentimental air; “you will, no doubt,
have to take a Lazaroni with you to show you the
way?” (?&nbsp;Cicerone).</p>

<p>“The scenery,” continued she, “isn’t equal, I
suppose, to that of Hoban. Do you know, I was a
great climber until I became subject to palpitations.
You wouldn’t think it, so robust as I am;
but I’m very delicate. My two families have been
too much for me.”</p>

<p>I imagined she had been married twice, or had
married a widower.</p>

<p>“You know,” continued she, confidentially, “I had
three children, and then I stopped for some years,
and began again, and had two more. Children are
such a plague. I went with them to the sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
would you believe it, every one of them took the
measles.”</p>

<p>But there was a little countrywoman of ours on
board whose vivacity and freshness made up for the
insipidity of the “Hoban lady.” She can’t bear
to think that she is doing no good in the world,
and spends much of her time in district visiting in
one of the largest parishes of the metropolis. Not
that she had a particle of the acid said to belong to
some of the so-called sisters of mercy&mdash;reckless
craft that, borne along by the gale of triumphant
vanity, have in mere wantonness run down many an
unsuspecting vessel&mdash;I mean trifled with honest
fellows’ affections, and then suddenly finding themselves
beached, in a matrimonial sense, irretrievably
pronounce all men, without exception, monsters.
And, thus, she whose true mission it was to be
“the Angel in the House,” presiding, ministering,
soothing, curdles up into a sour, uneasy devotee.</p>

<p>At sea, a wise traveller will be determined to
gather amusement from trifles; nay, even rather
than get put out by any delay or misadventure, set
about performing the difficult task of constructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. For instance, our
vessel, being overburdened, steered excessively ill,
as might be seen from her wake, which, for the
most part, assumed the shape of zigzags or arcs of
circles. This disconcerted one grumpy fellow uncommonly.
But we endeavoured to restore his
good humour by telling him that we were not practising
the “great” but the “little” circle sailing.
His mantling sulkiness seemed to evaporate at this
pleasantry; and, subsequently, when, on the coal
lessening, and lightening our craft astern, she
steered straighter, he facetiously apostrophized the
man at the wheel&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’re the man to take the kinks out of her
course; we must have you at the wheel all night,
and as much grog as you like, at my expense, afterwards.”</p>

<p>The captain, who was taken prisoner on returning
from the Davis’ Straits fishery, during the
French wars, and was detained seven years in
France, gives me some information about the Arctic
shark (Squalus Arcticus), which is now beginning
to reappear on the coast of Norway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“We used to call them the blind shark, sir&mdash;more
by token they would rush in among the nets
and seize our fish, paying no more attention to
us than nothing at all. They used to bite pieces
out of our fish just like a plate, and no mistake,
as clean as a whistle, sir. I’ve often stuck my
knife into ’em, but they did not wince in the least&mdash;they
did not appear to have no feeling whatsomdever.
I don’t think they had any blood in ’em; I
never saw any. I’ve put my hand in their body,
and it was as cold as ice.”</p>

<p>“By-the-bye, captain,” said I, to our commander,
who was a fubsy, little round red-faced man, with
a cheery blue eye, “how’s this? Why, you are in
uniform!”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am. Th’ Cumpany said it must
be done. Those furriners think more of you with
a bit of gowd lace on your cap and coat. An order
came from our governor to wear this here coat and
cap&mdash;so I put ’em on. What a guy I did look&mdash;just
like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”</p>

<p>“Or a daw in borrowed plumes,” suggested I.</p>

<p>“But I put a bould face on’t, and came a-board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and walked about just as if I had the old brown
coat on, and now I’ve got quite used to the
change.”</p>

<p>Now this little fellow is as clever as he is modest&mdash;every
inch a seaman. I’ve seen him calm and
collected in very difficult circumstances on this
treacherous old North Sea.</p>

<p>Last year, in the autumn, the captain tells me he
was approaching the Norwegian coast in the grey of
the morning when he descried what he took to be a
quantity of nets floating on the water, and several
boats hovering about them. He eased the engine for
fear of entangling the screw. Some Cockneys on
board, who wore nautical dresses, and sported gilt
buttons on which were engraved R. T. Y. C., laughed
at the captain for his excessive carefulness. Presently
it turned out that what had seemed to be
floating nets were the furniture and hencoops of
the ill-fated steamer <i>Norge</i>, which had just been
run down by another steamer, and sunk with a loss
of some half a hundred lives. A grave Norwegian
on board now lectured the young men for their
ignorance and bravado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“They just did look queer, I’ll a-warrant ye,” continued
our north-country captain. “They laughed
on t’other side of their mouths, and were mum
for the rest of the voyage.”</p>

<p>“What vessel’s that?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s the opposition&mdash;the Kangaroo.”</p>

<p>This was the captain’s pronunciation of <i>Gangr
Rolf</i> (Anglicè, Rollo, the Walker), the Norwegian
screw, which I hear rolls terribly in a sea-way.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” I exclaimed. “Saall for Gamle
Norge,” as we sighted the loom of the land. How
different it is from the English coast. The eye
will in vain look for the white perpendicular cliffs,
such as hedge so much of old Albion, their glistening
fronts relieved at intervals by streaks of darker
hue, where the retreating angle of the wall-like rock
does not catch the sun’s rays; while behind lie the
downs rising gently inland, with their waving fields
of corn or old pastures dotted with sheep. Quite
as vainly will you cast about for the low shores of
other parts of our island&mdash;diversified, it may be,
by yellow dunes, with the sprinkling of shaggy
flag-like grass, or, elsewhere, the flat fields terminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
imperceptibly in flatter sands, the fattening
ground of oysters.</p>

<p>As far as I can judge at this distance, instead of
the coast forming one sober businesslike line of
demarcation, with no nonsense about it, showing
exactly the limits of land and ocean, as in other
countries, here it is quite impossible to say where
water ends and land begins. It is neither fish nor
fowl. Those low, bare gneiss-rocks, for instance,
tumbled, as it were, into a lot of billows. One would
almost think they had got a footing among the
waves by putting on the shape and aspect of water.
Well, if you scan them accurately you find they are
unmistakeably bits of islands. But as we approach
nearer, look further inland to those low hills
covered with pine-trees, which somehow or other
have managed to wax and pick up a livelihood
in the clefts and crannies of the rocks, or sometimes
even on the bare scarps. While ever and
anon a bald-topped rock protruding from the dark
green masses stands like a solitary Friar of Orders
Grey, with his well shaven tonsure, amid a crowd
of black cowled Dominicans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Surely that,” you’ll say, “is the coast line
proper?”</p>

<p>“Wrong again, sir. It is a case of wheels within
wheels; or, to be plain, islands within islands.
Behind those wooded heights there are all sorts
of labyrinths of salt water, some ending in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>,
others coming out, when you least expect it,
into the open sea again, and forming an inland
passage for many miles. If that myth about King
Canute bidding the waves not come any further,
had been told of this country, there would have
been some sense in it, and he might have appeared
to play the wave-compeller to some purpose. For
really, in some places, it is only by a nice examination
one can say how far the sea’s rule does
extend.”</p>

<p>The whole of the coast is like this, except between
the Naze and Stavanger, rising at times, as
up the West Coast, into magnificent precipices, but
still beaded with islands from the size of a pipe
of port to that of an English county. Hence there
are two ways of sailing along the coast, “indenskjærs,”
<i>i.e.</i>, within the “skerries,” and “udenskjærs,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
or outside of the “skerries,” <i>i.e.</i>, in the
open sea. The inner route has been followed by
coasters from the days of the Vikings. Those pilots
on the Norwegian Government steam-vessels whom
you see relieving each other alternately on the bridge,
spitting thoughtfully a brown fluid into a wooden
box, and gently moving their hand when we thread
the watery Thermopylæ, are men bred up from
boyhood on the coast, and know its intricacies by
heart. The captain is, in fact, a mere cypher, as
far as the navigation is concerned.</p>

<p>“You’ve never been in Norway before?” I inquired
of the fair Samaritan.</p>

<p>“No; this is my first visit. I hope I shall
like it.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine you will. If you are a lover of
fashion and formality, you will not be at ease in
Norway. The good folks are simple-minded and
sincere. If they invite you to an entertainment, it
is because they are glad to see you. Not to fill up
a place at the table, or because they are obliged to
do the civil, at the same time hoping sincerely you
won’t come. Their forefathers were men of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
self-denial, and intensely fond of liberty. When it
was not to be had at home, they did what those
birds were doing that rested on our mast during
the voyage, migrated to a more congenial clime&mdash;in
their case to Iceland. The present Norwegians
have a good deal of the same sturdy independence
about them; some travellers say, to an unpleasant
degree. It’s true they are rather rough and uncouth;
but, like their forefathers, when they came
in contact with old Roman civilization in France
and Normandy, they will progress and improve by
intercourse with the other peoples of Europe.</p>

<p>“Their old mythology is grand in the extreme.
Look at that rainbow, yonder. In their eyes, the
bow in the cloud was the bridge over which lay the
road to Valhalla. Then their legends. Do you know,
I think that much of our fairy lore came over to
us from Norway, just as the seeds of the mountain-flowers
in Scotland are thought by Forbes to have
come over from Scandinavia on the ice-floes during
the glacial period. If I had time, I could tell you a
lot of sprite-stories; among others, one how the elves
all left Jutland one night in an old wreck, lying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the shore, and got safe to Norway. To this country,
at all events, those lines won’t yet apply:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Two Englishmen were on board the <i>Lindesnaes</i>,
who had been fishing a week in the Torrisdal Elv,
and had had two rises and caught nothing; so
they are moving along the coast to try another
river. But it is too late for this part of Norway.
These are early rivers, and the fish have been too
long up to afford sport with the fly.</p>

<p>The proverb, “never too old to learn,” was practically
brought to my mind in an old Norwegian
gentleman on board.</p>

<p>“My son, sir, has served in the English navy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I am seventy years old, and can speak some English.
I will talk in that language and you in Norwegian,
and so we shall both learn. You see, sir, we are
now going into Arendal. This is a bad entrance
when the wind is south-west, so we are clearing
out that other passage there to the eastward.
There is a diver at work there always. Oh, sir,
he’s frightful to behold! First, he has a great
helmet, and lumps of lead on his shoulders, and
lead on his thighs, and lead on his feet. All lead,
sir! And then he has a dagger in his belt.”</p>

<p>“A dagger!” said I; “what’s that for?”</p>

<p>“Oh! to keep off the amphibia and sea-monsters;
they swarm upon this coast.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old gentleman contorted his
countenance in such a manner that he, at all events,
let alone the diver, was frightful to behold. Such
was the effect of the mere thought of the amphibia
and sea-monsters. Fortunately, his head was
covered, or I can’t answer for it that each particular
hair would not have stood on end like to the
quills of the fretful porcupine. It struck me that
he must have been reading of Beowulf, the Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hero, and his friend Breca, and how they
had naked swords in their hands to defend them
against the sea-monsters, and how Beowulf served
the creatures out near the bottom of the sea (sae-grunde
néah).</p>

<p>At Arendal, where the vessel stops for some
hours, I take a stroll with a Norwegian schoolboy.
Abundance of sycamore and horse-chesnut, arrayed
in foliage of the most vivid hue, grow in the pretty
little ravines about this Norwegian Venice, as it is
called.</p>

<p>“What is the name of that tree in Norsk,” I
asked of my companion, pointing to a sycamore.</p>

<p>“Ask, <i>i.e.</i> ash.”</p>

<p>“And of that?” inquired I, pointing to a horse-chesnut.</p>

<p>“Ask,” was again the reply.</p>

<p>Close to the church was the dead-house, where
corpses are placed in winter, when the snow prevents
the corpse being carried to the distant
cemetery. In the little land-locked harbour I see a
quantity of small skiffs, here called “pram,” which
are to be had new for the small price of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dollars, or thirteen shillings and sixpence English.
The vicinity of this place is the most famous in
Norway for mineralogical specimens. Arendal has,
I believe, the most tonnage and largest-sized vessels
of any port in Norway. Ship-building is going
forward very briskly all along the coast since the
alteration in the English navigation laws. At
Grimstead, which we passed, I observed eight
vessels on the stocks: at Stavanger there are
twenty.</p>

<p>The reader is perhaps not aware that, reckoning
the fjords, there is a sea-board of no less than
eight thousand English miles in Norway&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
there is to every two and a half square miles of
country a proportion of about one mile of sea-coast.
This superfluity of brine will become more
apparent by comparing the state of things in other
countries. According to Humboldt, the proportion
in Africa is one mile of sea-coast to one
hundred and forty-two square miles of land. In
Asia, one to one hundred. In North America, one
to fifty-seven. In Europe, one to thirty-one.</p>

<p>With such an abundance of “water, water everywhere”&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mean salt, not fresh&mdash;one would hardly
expect to meet with persons travelling from home
for the sake of sea-bathing. And yet such is the
case. On board is a lady going to the sea-baths
of Sandefjord. She tells me there is quite a gathering
of fashionables there at times. Last year, the
wife of the Crown Prince, a Dutch woman by
birth, was among the company. She spent most
of her time, I understood, in sea-fishing. Besides
salt-water baths, there are also baths of rotten seaweed,
which are considered quite as efficacious for
certain complaints as the mud-baths of Germany.
Landing at Langesund, I start for Skien on board
the little steamer <i>Traffic</i>.</p>

<p>A bonder of Thelemark is on board, whose costume,
in point of ugliness, reminds one of the dress
of some of the peasants of Bavaria. Its chief characteristics
were its short waist and plethora of
buttons. The jacket is of grey flannel, with curious
gussets or folds behind. The Quaker collar and
wristbands are braided with purple. Instead of the
coat and waistcoat meeting the knee-breeches halfway,
after the usual fashion, the latter have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ascend nearly up to the arm-pits before an intimacy
between these two articles of dress is effected.
Worsted stockings of blue and white,
worked into stars and stripes, are joined at the foot
by low shoes, broad-toed, like those of Bavaria,
while the other end of the man&mdash;I mean his head&mdash;is
surmounted by a hat, something like an hourglass
in shape.</p>

<p>The fondness of these people for silver ornaments
is manifest in the thickly-set buttons of the
jacket, on which I see is stamped the intelligent
physiognomy of that king of England whose equestrian
statue adorns Pig-tail-place; his breeches
and shoes also are each provided with a pair of
buckles, likewise of silver.</p>

<p>Contrasting with this odd-looking monster is
a Norwegian young lady, with neat modern costume,
and pair of English gauntlet kid gloves.
Her bouquet is somewhat peculiar; white lilies,
mignionette, asparagus-flower, dahlias, and roses.
Her carpet-bag is in a cover, like a white pillowcase.</p>

<p>Bears, I see by a newspaper on board, are terribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
destructive this year in Norway. One bruin
has done more than his share. He has killed two
cows, and wounded three more; not to mention
sheep, which he appears to take by way of <i>hors
d’œuvres</i>. Lastly, he has killed two horses; and
the peasants about Vaasen, where all this happened,
have offered eight dollars (thirty-six shillings)
for his apprehension, dead or alive.</p>

<p>At the top of the fjord, fourteen English miles
from the sea, lies Skien. The source of its
prosperity and bustle are its saw-mills. Like
Shakspeare’s Justice, it is full of saws. The vast
water-power caused by the descent of the contents
of the Nord-Sö is here turned to good account:
setting going a great number of wheels. Two
hundred and fifty dozen logs are sawn into planks
per week; and the vessels lie close by, with
square holes in their bows for the admission of the
said planks into their holds. All the population
seems to be occupied in the timber trade. Saws
creaking and fizzing, men dashing out in little
shallops after timbers that have just descended the
foss, others fastening them to the endless chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
which is to drag them up to the place of execution;
while the wind flaunts saw-dust into your face, and
the water is like the floor of a menagerie. That
unfortunate salmon, which has just sprung into the
air at the bottom of the foss, near the old Roman
Catholic monastery, must be rather disgusted at
the mouthful he got as he plunged into the stream
again.</p>

<p>But we must return to the modern Skien. This
timber-built city was nearly half burnt down not
long ago; but as a matter of course the place is
being rebuilt of the old material. Catch a Norwegian,
if he can help it, building his house of stone.
Stone-houses are so cold and comfortless, he says.
Since the fire, cigar-smoking has been forbidden in
the streets under a penalty of four orts, or three
shillings and fourpence sterling, for each offence.</p>

<p>The great man of Skien appears to be one Christopher
Hansen Blum.</p>

<p>“Whose rope-walk is that?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Hansen Blum’s.”</p>

<p>“And that great saw-mill?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Hansen Blum’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“And those warehouses?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Hansen Blum’s.”</p>

<p>“And that fine lady?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Hansen Blum’s wife.”</p>

<p>“And the other fine lady, my fair travelling
companion with the gauntlet kid gloves?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Hansen Blum’s niece.”</p>

<p>This modern Marquis of Carabas (<i>vide Puss in
Boots</i>) is also, I understand, one of the chief promoters
of the canal which is being quarried out of
the solid rock between Skien and the Nord-Sö;
the completion of which will admit of an uninterrupted
steam traffic from this place to Hitterdal,
at the northern end of that lake, and deep in the
bowels of Thelemarken.</p>

<p>A great stir has been lately caused at Skien by
the secession from the establishment of Gustav
Adolph Lammers, the vicar of the place. The
history of this gentleman is one of the many indications
to be met with of this country having arrived
at that period in the history of its civilization
which the other countries of Europe have passed
many years ago;&mdash;we mean the phase of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
development of religious dissent and a spirit of insubordination
to the established traditions of the
Church as by law established. We are transported
to the days of Whitfield and Wesley. Lammers,
who appears to be a sincere person, in spite of the
variety of tales in circulation about him, commenced
by inculcating greater strictness of conduct. He
next declined to baptize children. This brought
him necessarily into conflict with the church authorities,
and the upshot was that he has seceded from
the Church; together with a number of the fair
sex, with whom he is a great favourite. The most
remarkable part of the matter, however, is that he
will apply, it is said, for a Government pension,
like other retiring clergy. Whether the Storthing,
within whose province all such questions come, will
listen to any such thing remains to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A tract in my possession professes to be the Confession
of Faith of this “New Apostolic Church.”
In the preamble they state that they wish to make
proper use of God’s Word and Sacraments. But
as they don’t see how they can do this in the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Church, in which the Word is not properly preached,
nor the Sacraments duly administered, they have
determined to leave it, and form a separate community,
in conformity with the Norwegian Dissenter
Law of July 16, 1845. The baptism of infants
they consider opposed to Holy Writ. All that
the Bible teaches is to bring young children to
Christ, with prayer and laying on of hands, and
to baptize them when they can believe that Jesus
Christ is the son of God, and will promise to
obey his Gospel. Hence the elders lay hands
upon young children, and at the same time read
Mark x., verses 13-17. At a later period, these
children are baptized by immersion. The Holy
Communion is taken once a month, each person
helping himself to the elements; confession or
absolution, previously, are not required.</p>

<p>The community are not bound to days and high-tides,
but it is quite willing to accept the days of
rest established by law, on which they meet and
read the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Marriage is a civil contract, performed before a
notarius publicus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The dead are buried in silence, being borne to
the grave by some of the brethren; after the grave
is filled up a psalm is sung.</p>

<p>All the members of the community agree to submit,
if necessary, to brotherly correction; and if
this is of no avail, to expulsion. Temporary exclusion
from the communion is the correction to be
preferred. These rules were accepted by ten men
and twenty-eight women, on the 4th July, 1856&mdash;giving
each other their right hand, and promising,
by God’s help,</p>

<p>We have given the following particulars, because
the state of the Christian religion in Norway must
for ever be deeply interesting to England, if on no
other account, for this reason, that in this respect
she is the spiritual offspring of Great Britain.
Charlemagne tried to convert Scandinavia, but he
failed to reach Norway. The Benedictine monk,
Ansgar of Picardy, went to Sweden, but never penetrated
hither; in fact, the Norsk Christian Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is entirely a daughter of the English. The first
missionaries came over with Hacon the Good, the
foster son of our King Athelstan; and though
this attempt failed, through the tenacity of the
people for heathenesse, yet the second did not,
when Olaf Trygveson brought over missionaries
from the north of England&mdash;Norwegian in blood
and speech&mdash;and christianized the whole coast,
from Sweden to Trondjem, in the course of one
year&mdash;996-997.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Next day, at five o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, I drove off to the head
of the Nord-Sö, distant half-a-dozen miles off, and
got on board the steamer, which was crowded with
passengers. An old gentleman on board attracted
my attention. His dress was just like that of a livery
servant in a quiet family in England&mdash;blue coat,
with stand-up collar, and two rows of gold lace
round it. This I find is the uniform of a sörenskriver.
Konrad Swach&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;is
a poet of some repute in this country. His most
popular effusion is on the national flag of Norway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which was granted to them by the present King,
Oscar&mdash;a theme, be it remarked, which would have
secured popularity for a second-rate poem among
these patriotic Northmen. To judge from the poet’s
nose, it struck me that some of his poetic inspirations
is due to drink. The front part of the vessel
is beset by Thelemarken bonders, male and female,
in their grotesque dress.</p>

<p>The young lady in gauntlet gloves is also on
board, whom I make bold to address, on the
strength of our having journeyed together yesterday.
As we steam along through the usual Norwegian
scenery of pines and grey rocks, she points
out to me the mouth of a curious cave.</p>

<p>“That is Saint Michael’s Church, as it is called.
The opening is about sixteen feet wide, and about
as many high, and goes some eighty feet into the
cliff. In the Catholic times, it was used as a
church, and became a regular place of pilgrimage,
and was regarded as a spot of peculiar sanctity. In
the sixteenth century, as the story goes, when the
reformed faith had been introduced into the country,
the clergyman of the parish of Solum, in which St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Michael’s was situate, was one Mr. Tovel. Formerly
a soldier, he was a man of strong will, zealous
for the new religion, and a determined uprooter of
‘the Babylonian remnants of popery,’ as he phrased
it. The church in the cave was now sadly come
down in the world, and had been despoiled of all its
valuables. But in the eyes of the bonders, who,
with characteristic tenacity of character, adhered to
the old faith, it had risen higher in proportion.
Numerous pilgrims resorted to it, and miracles were
said to be wrought at the spot. At night, it was said,
soft singing might be heard, and a stream of light
seen issuing from the orifice, which lies four hundred
feet above the water.</p>

<p>“One autumn evening, the reverend Mr. Tovel
was rowing by the place when the above light suddenly
illumined the dark waters. The boatmen
rested on their oars and crossed themselves. Tovel
urged them to land, but in vain. Determined,
however, on investigating the matter himself, he
obtained the services of two men from a neighbouring
village, who apparently had less superstitious
scruples than his own attendants, and watched from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
his abode, on the other side of the lake, for the reappearance
of the light. On the eve of St. Michael
he looks out, and sure enough the light was visible.
Off he sets, with his two men, taking with him his
Bible and sword. The night was still, with a few
stars shining overhead. Reaching the foot of the
rock, the priest sprang ashore, and invited the boatmen
to accompany him, but not a step would they
go. The superstition bred in the bone was not so
easily to be eradicated, even by the coin and persuasion
of Herr Tovel.</p>

<p>“‘Cowards! stay here, then,’ exclaimed his reverence,
as he started up the steep ascent alone.
After a hard scramble, he stood a foot or two below
the cavern, when just as his head came on a level
with its mouth the light suddenly vanished. At
this trying moment, Tovel bethought him of the
great Reformer, how he fought with and overcame
the Evil One. This gave him fresh courage, and he
entered the cavern, singing lustily Luther’s psalm&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘En Berg saa fast er os vor Gud,</div>
<div class="verse">So godt et Skiold og Vaerge;</div>

<div class="verse">Han kan og nun os bierge.’</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>“At the last words the light suddenly reappeared.
An aged priest, dressed up in the full paraphernalia
of the Romish church, issues from a hidden door in
the interior of the cave, and greets Tovel with the
words&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Guds Fred,’ (God’s peace); ‘why should I
fear those who come in God’s name?’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ exclaimed the astonished Tovel; ‘is
it true, then, that Rome’s priests are still in the
land?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes; and you are come sword in hand to
drive out a poor old priest whose only weapon is
a staff.’</p>

<p>“As he spoke, the door of an inner recess rolled
back, and Tovel beheld an altar illuminated with
iron lamps, over which hung a picture of St.
Michael, the saint often worshipped in caves and
mountains.</p>

<p>“‘It is your pestiferous doctrines against which I
wage war, not against your person,’ rejoined Tovel.
‘Who are you, in God’s name?’</p>

<p>“‘I am Father Sylvester, the last priest of this
Church. When the new religion was forced upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the land, I wandered forth, and am now returned
once more, to die where I have lived. The good
people of Gisholdt Gaard have secretly supported
me.’</p>

<p>“Moved with this recital, the Lutheran priest asks&mdash;‘And
are you trying to seduce the people back
to the old religion?’</p>

<p>“The aged man rejoins, with vehemence&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘It were an easy task, did I wish to do so; but
I do not. It is only at night that I say prayers
and celebrate mass in the inner sacristy there.’</p>

<p>“Tovel, thoroughly softened, when he finds that
his beloved Reformed faith was not likely to suffer,
finishes the conversation by saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Old man, you shall not lack anything that it
is in my power to give you. Send to me for
aught that you may have need of.’</p>

<p>“The venerable priest points to the stars, and
exclaims, solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘That God, yonder, will receive both of us,
Protestant and Catholic.’</p>

<p>“After this they cordially shook hands. Tovel
went home an altered man. Some time afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the light ceased to shine entirely. He knew why.
Old Father Sylvester was no more.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tovel got off much better than many clergymen
of the Reformed faith in those days. Old
Peder Clausen, the chronicler, relates that he knew
a man whose father had knocked three clergymen
on the head. The stern old Norwegian bonders
could ill brook the violence with which the Danes
introduced Lutheranism; a violence not much
short of that used by King Olaf in rooting out
heathenism, and which cost him his life.”</p>

<p>I thanked the young lady for her interesting
information.</p>

<p>Presently a curious figure comes out of the
cabin. It was a fine-looking old man, with white
hair, and hooked nose, and keen eyes, shadowed by
shaggy eyebrows. His dress consisted of a blue
superfine frock-coat, with much faded gold embroidery
on a stand-up collar; dark breeches, and
Hessian boots. On his breast shone the Grand
Cross of the North Star. A decided case of Commissioner
Pordage, of the island of Silver-Store,
with his “Diplomatic coat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>That’s old Baron W&mdash;&mdash;, the last remnant
of the Norsk nobility. He wears the dress of
an Amtman, which office he formerly held, and
loses no opportunity of displaying it and the
star. He it was who in 1821 protested against
the phævelse (abolition) of the nobility. The
Baron was evidently quite aware of the intense
impression he was making upon the Thelemarken
bonders. On our both landing, subsequently, at a
station called Ulefoss, I was highly diverted at seeing
him take off his coat and star and deposit the
same in a travelling-bag, from which he drew forth
a less pretending frock, first taking care to fold up
the diplomatic coat with all the precision displayed
by that little man of Cruikshank’s in wrapping
up Peter Schlemil’s shadow. We both of us are
bound, I find, for the steamer on the Bandagsvand.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we waiting for?” said I, to the
man who had brought my horse and carriole.</p>

<p>“Oh, we must not start before the Baron.
People always make way for him. He won’t like
us to start first.”</p>

<p>“Jump up,” said I, putting my nag in motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and leaving the Baron in the lurch, who was magniloquizing
to the people around. All the bonders
“wo-ho’d” my horse, in perfect astonishment at
my presumption, while the Baron, with a fierce
gleam of his eye, whipped his horse into motion.
I soon found the advantage of being first, as the
road was dreadfully dusty; and being narrow, I
managed to keep the Baron last, and swallowing
my dust for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>We were soon at Naes, on the Bandagsvand,
where lay the little steamer which was to hurry
us forty-two miles further into Thelemarken, to a
spot called Dal. The hither end of the lake, which
is properly called Hvide-sö (white-sea), is separated
from the upper, or Bandagsvand, by a very narrow
defile jammed in between tremendous precipices.
We pass the church of Laurvig on the right, which
is said to be old and interesting. The clergyman,
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, is on board. He tells me that the
odd custom of spooning dust into a small hole
(see <i>Oxonian in Norway</i>) is not usual in this part
of Norway. The term used for it is “jords-paakastelse.”
The burial-service is very brief; being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
confined to the words, “Af Jord er du, Til Jord
skal du blive, ud af Jord skal du opstaae.”</p>

<p>For his fee he receives from one ort = tenpence,
to sixteen dollars, according to circumstances.
In the latter case there would be a long
funeral oration. Close by the church is the farm
of Tvisæt (twice-sown), so called, it is said, because
it often produced two crops a year. Although
placed in the midst of savage and desolate
scenery, the spot is so sheltered that it will grow
figs in the open air.</p>

<p>The Sörenskriver is also on board, the next
Government officer to the Amtman, or governor
of the province. He is going to a “Skifte,” as it
is called. This word is the technical expression
for dividing the property of a deceased person
among his heirs, and is as old as Harald Hârfager,
the same expression being used in Snorro’s
Chronicle of his division of his kingdom
among his sons. In this simple country there is
no necessity for Doctors’ Commons. The relatives
meet, and if there is no will the property is divided,
according to law, among the legal heirs: if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is one, its provisions are carried out: the Sörenskriver,
by his presence, sanctioning the legality
of the proceeding.</p>

<p>He informs me that there is generally a kind of
lyke-wake on the melancholy occasion, where the
“grave öl” and “arve öl,” “grave ale,” or “heirship
ale,” is swallowed in considerable quantities.
In a recent Skifte, at which he presided, the executors
charged, among the expenses to come out
of the estate, one tonder malt and sixty-five pots
of brantviin; while for the burial fee to the priest,
the modest sum of one ort was charged. While the
Sörenskriver was overhauling these items with critical
eye, the peasant executor, who thought the
official was about to take exception to the last
item, or perhaps, which is more likely, wishing to
divert his attention from the unconscionable charge
for drink, observed that he really could not get
the funeral service performed for less. The pastoral
office would seem, from this, not to occupy
a very high position among these clod-hoppers.
Sixty-five pots, or pints, of brandy, a huge barrel
of malt liquor, and ten-pennyworth of parson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. C., who is acquainted with Mr. Gieldrup,
the priestly Samson of Aal, in Hallingdal, gives
me some account of his taking the shine out of
Rotner Knut, the cock and bully of the valley. It
was on the occasion of Knut being married, and
the parson was invited to the entertainment, together
with his family. During the banquet,
Rotner, evidently with the intention of annoying
the priest, amused himself by pulling the legs of
his son. Offended at the insult, Gieldrup seized
the peasant, and hurled him with such force
against the wooden door of the room, that
he smashed through it. After which the parson
resumed his place at the board, while
Knut put his tail between his legs, as much
abashed as Gunther, in the Nibelungenlied,
when, at his wedding, he was tied up to a
peg in the wall by his bride, the warrior virgin
Brunhild.</p>

<p>It is customary in Hallingdal, where this occurred,
to accompany the Hallingdance with the
voice. One of the favourite staves in the valley
had been&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Rotner Knut, Rotner Knut,</div>
<div class="verse">He is the boy to pitch the folks out.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was now altered, and ran as follows, greatly to
Knut’s chagrin,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Rotner Knut, Rotner Knut,</div>
<div class="verse">The priest is the man to pitch him out.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On another occasion, Gieldrup was marrying
two or three couples, when one of the bridegrooms,
impatient to be off, vaulted over the chancel rails,
and asked what was to pay. In the twinkling
of an eye the muscular parson caught him by
the shoulders and hurled him right over the
heads of the bystanders, who stood round the
rails.</p>

<p>As we steam along, the Sörenskriver points out
to me, on the top of the lofty rocks on the left, a
rude representation in stone of a ship, which goes
by the name of “Olaf’s skib.” Among other
idiosyncrasies of the saint and martyr, one was,
that of occasionally sailing over land. How his
vessel came to be stranded here, I cannot learn.
Further on, to the right, you see two figures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
stone, one of which appears to have lost its head,
not metaphorically, but in the real guillotine
sense.</p>

<p>The bonders will give you a very circumstantial
account, part of which will not bear repetition
here, how that this is a Jotul, who had some
domestic unpleasantness with his lady, and treated
her at once like the Defender of the Faith
did Anne Boleyn (we beg pardon of Mr.
Froude) casting her head across the water,
where it is still lying, under the pine trees
yonder, only that the steamer cannot stop to let
us see it. The lady and gentleman were petrified
in consequence.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And lo! where stood a hag before,</div>
<div class="verse">Now stands a ghastly stone, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I see you speak Norsk,” said the Sörenskriver,
“but you will find it of very little use yonder, at
Dal. The dialect of Thelemarken, generally, is
strange, but at Dal it is almost incomprehensible,
even to us Norwegians. It is generally believed
that the language here still possesses a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the tone and turn of the old Icelandic, which
was once spoken all the country through.”</p>

<p>I did not, however, find it so difficult. The
Norwegians look upon English, I may here remark,
as hard to pronounce. On that notable
occasion, say they, when the Devil boiled the languages
together, English was the scum that came
to the top. A criticism more rude than even that
of Charles V.</p>

<p>As we approach the landing-place, to my astonishment,
I perceive a gentleman fly-fishing at the
outlet of the stream into the lake.</p>

<p>He turned out to be Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, who is traversing
the country, at the expense of the Government,
to teach the people the method of increasing,
by artificial means, the breed of salmon and other
fish. He tells me, that last year he caught, one
morning here, thirty-five trout, weighing from one
to six pounds each.</p>

<p>His operations in the artificial breeding-line
have been most successful; not only with salmon,
but with various kinds of fish. He tells me it
is a mistake to suppose that the roe will only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
productive if put in water directly. He has preserved
it for a long period, transporting it great
distances without its becoming addle, and gives
me a tract which he has published on the subject.
As we are just now at home in England talking of
stocking the Antipodal rivers with salmon, this
topic is of no little interest. The method of transporting
the roe in Norway is in a wooden box,
provided with shelves, one above another, and two
or three inches apart, and drilled with small holes.
Upon these is laid a thin layer of clean, moist,
white, or moor, moss (not sand), and upon that
the roe, which has already been milted. This is
moistened every day. If the cold is very great,
the box is placed within another, and chaff placed
in the interstices between the two boxes. In this
way roe has been conveyed from Leirdalsören to
Christiania, a week’s journey. Professor Rasch,
who first employed moss in the transport, has
also discovered that it is the best material for
laying on the bottom of the breeding stews, the
stalks placed streamwise. Moss is best for two
reasons: first, it counteracts the tendency of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
water to freeze; and secondly, it catches the particles
of dirt which float down the stream, and
have an affinity rather for it than for the roe.
The roe is best placed touching the surface of the
stream, but it fructifies very well even when placed
half, or even more, out of the water. Care is
taken to remove from the stews such eggs as become
mouldy, this being an indication that they
are addle. If this is not done, the mouldiness
soon spreads to the other good roe, and renders
it bad. With regard to the nursery-ground itself,
it is of course necessary to select a spring
for this purpose which will not freeze in winter,
and further, to protect the water from the cold
by a roofing or house of wood.</p>

<p>I suppose the next thing we shall hear of
will be, that roe that has been packed up for
years will, by electricity or some sort of hocus-pocus,
be turned to good account, just as the ears
of corn in the Pyramids have been metamorphosed
into standing crops. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;’s avocation, by-the-bye,
reminds me of an old Norwegian legend
about “The Fishless Lake” in Valders. Formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it abounded with fish; but one night the proprietor
set a quantity of nets, all of which had
disappeared by the next morning. Well, the
Norwegian, in his strait, had recourse to his
Reverence, who anathematized the net-stealer.
Nothing more came of it till the next spring;
when, upon the ice breaking, all the nets rose
to the surface, full of dead fish. Since then
no fish has been found in the lake. Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; might probably succeed in dissolving the
charm.</p>

<p>“I see you are a fisherman,” said Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;;
“you’ll find the parson at Mö, in Butnedal, a few
miles off, an ‘ivrig fisker’ (passionate fisherman)&mdash;ay!
and his lady, too. They’ll be delighted to
see you. They have no neighbours, hardly, but
peasants, and your visit will confer a greater
favour on them than their hospitality on you.
That is a very curious valley, sir. There are
several ‘tomter’ (sites) of farm-houses, now deserted,
where there once were plenty of people:
that is one of the vestiges of the Black Death.”</p>

<p>On second thoughts, however, he informed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that it was just possible that Parson S&mdash;&mdash; might
be away; as at this period of the summer, when
all the peasants are up with their cattle at the
Sæters, the clergy, having nothing whatever to
do, take their holiday.</p>

</div>

<p>Mine host at Dal, a venerable-looking personage,
with long grey hair floating on his shoulders, was
a member of the Extraordinary Meeting of Deputies
at Eidsvold in 1815, when the Norwegians
accepted the Junction with Sweden. I and the
old gentleman exchanged cards. The superscription
on his was&mdash;Gaardbruger Norgaard, Deputeret
fra Norges Storthing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Farmer Norgaard,
A Deputy from Norway’s Storthing.</p>

<p>Another reminiscence of his early days is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
framed and glazed copy of the Grundlov (Fundamental
Law) of Norway, its palladium of national
liberty, which a hundred and twelve Deputies
drew up in six weeks, in 1814. Never was Constitution
so hastily drawn up, and so generally
practical and sensible as this.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince, the crafty Bernadotte, with
his invading army of Swedes, had Norway quite
at his mercy on that occasion; but the idea seems
to have struck him suddenly that it was as well
not to deal too hardly with her, as in case of his
not being able to hold his own in Sweden, he
might have a worse place of refuge than among
the sturdy Norwegians. “I am resolved what to
do, so that when I am put out of the stewardship
they may receive me into their houses.” So he
assented to Norway’s independence.</p>

<p>For my part, at this moment, I thought more
about coffee than Norwegian liberty and politics;
but as it was nine o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, the good people
were quite put out by the request. Coffee in the
forenoon, say they, tea in the evening. As it was,
they made me pay pretty smartly for the accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
next morning. “What’s to pay?” said
I, striding into the room, where sat the old Deputy’s
daughter, the mistress of the house, at the
morning meal. She had not long ago become a
widow, and had taken as her second husband, a
few days before, a grisly-looking giant, who sat
by in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>“Ask <i>him</i>,” said the fair Quickly, thinking it
necessary, perhaps, just so recently after taking
the vow of obedience, by this little piece of deference
to her new lord to express her sense of
submission to his authority. For my part, as an
old traveller, I should rather say she did it for
another feeling. English pigeons did not fly that
way every day, and so they must be plucked; and
the person to do it, she thought, was the Berserker,
her awful-looking spouse. The charge
was exorbitant; and as the good folks were regaling
themselves with fresh mutton-chops and
strawberries and cream, while they had fobbed us
off with eggs and black bread and cheese&mdash;the
latter so sharp that it went like a dagger to my
very vitals at the first taste&mdash;I resolutely taxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the bill of costs, and carried my point; whereupon
we took leave of the Deputy and his descendants.</p>

<p>In one sense we had come to the world’s end;
for there is no road for wheels beyond this. The
footpath up the steep cliff that looks down upon
the lake is only accessible to the nimble horses of
the country. “Hurrah!” exclaimed I, as I looked
down on the blue lake, lying hundreds of feet
perpendicularly below us. “Hurrah for the mountains!
Adieu to the ‘boppery bop’ of civilization,
with all its forms and ceremonies, and turnpikes
and twaddle. Here you can eat, and drink, and
dress as and when you like, and that is just
the fun of the thing, more than half the relaxation
of the trip.” Why, this passion for mountain-travelling
over the hills and far away is not
peculiar to Englishmen. Don’t the ladies of
Teheran, even, after their listless “<i>vie à la pantoufle</i>,”
delight to hear of the approach of the
plague, as they know they are sure to get off to
the hills, and have a little tent-life in consequence?
Didn’t that fat boy Buttons (not in Pickwick, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Horace), cloyed with the Priest’s luscious cheesecakes,
long for a bit of coarse black bread, and run
away from his master to get it?</p>

<p>The precipitous path is studded at intervals
with heaps of hones, or whet-stones. I find that
about here is the chief manufacture in all Norway
for this article. One year, a third of a million
were turned out. The next quarry in importance
is at Kinservik, on the Hardanger Fjord. Surmounting
the ascent, we traverse swampy ground
dotted with birch-trees, and presently debouch
upon one of those quaint edifices not to be found
out of this country&mdash;stabskirke (stave church), as
it is called&mdash;of which Borgund and Hitterdal
Churches are well-known specimens. It is so
called from the lozenge-shaped shingles (staves),
overlapping each other like fish-scales, which
case the roof and every part of the outside.
Smaller and less pretending than those edifices,
this secluded place of worship was of the same
age&mdash;about nine hundred years. The resinous
pine has done its work well, and the carving on
the capitals of the wooden pillars at the doorway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
is in good preservation, though parts have lately
been churchwardenized.</p>

<p>“That is Eidsborg church,” said a young
student, who had volunteered to accompany me, as he
was bound to a lone parsonage up the country, in
this direction. “This is the church the young lady
on board the steamer told you was so remarkable.”</p>

<p>After making a rough sketch of the exterior, we
proceeded on our journey. The few huts around
were tenantless, the inhabitants all gone up to the
châlets. The blanching bear-skulls on the door of
one of these showed the wildness of the country we
are traversing; while a black-throated diver,
which was busy ducking after the fish in the
sedge-margined pool close by, almost tempted me
to load, and have a long shot at him. As we
proceed, I observe fieldfares, ring-ouzel, and chaff-finches,
while many English wild flowers enliven
the scene, and delicious strawberries assuage our
thirst. Pursuing our path through the forest, we
come to a post on which is written “Ravne jüv,”
Anglicè, Raven depth.</p>

<p>“Det maa De see,” (you must see that,) said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
my companion, turning off up a narrow path, and
frightening a squirrel and a capercailzie, which
were apparently having a confab about things in
general. I followed him through the pine-wood,
getting over the swampy ground by the aid of
some fallen trunks, and, in two or three minutes,
came to the “Ravne jüv.” It is made by the
Sandok Elv, which here pierces through the
mountains, and may be seen fighting its way
thousands of feet below us. Where I stood, the
cliff was perpendicular, or rather sloped inwards;
and, by a singular freak of nature, a regular embrasured
battlement had been projected forward, so
as to permit of our approaching the giddy verge
with perfect impunity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Es schwebt eine <i>Brustwehre</i> über den Rand</div>

<div class="verse indent1">Es hätte sich’s Keiner verwogen.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lying flat, I put my head through an embrasure,
and looked down into the Raven’s depth.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s deeper than you think,” said my companion.
“Watch this piece of wood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>I counted forty before it reached a landing-place,
and that was not above half the way.</p>

<p>Annoyed at our intrusion, two buff-coloured
hawks and a large falcon kept flying backwards
and forwards within shot, having evidently chosen
this frightful precipice as the safest place they could
find for their young. Luckily for them, the horse
and guide had gone on with my fowling-piece, or
they might have descended double-quick into
the sable depths below, and become a repast for
the ravens; who, as in duty bound, of course
frequent the recesses of their namesake, although
none were now visible.</p>

<p>What a pity a bit of scenery like this cannot be
transported to England. The Norwegians look
upon rocks as a perfect nuisance, while we sigh
for them. Fancy the Ravne jüv in Derbyshire.
Why, we should have Marcus’ excursion-trains
every week in the summer, and motley crowds of
tourists thronging to have a peep into the dark
profound, and some throwing themselves from
the top of it, as they used to do from the
Monument, and John Stubbs incising his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
on the battlements, cutting boldly as the Roman
king did at the behests of that humbugging augur;
and another true Briton breaking off bits of the
parapet, just like those immortal excursionists who
rent the Blarney Stone in two. Then there would
be a grand hotel close by, and greasy waiters with
white chokers, and the nape of their neck shaven as
smooth as a vulture’s head (faugh!) and their front
and back hair parted in one continuous straight
line, just like the wool of my lady’s poodle. How
strongly they would recommend to your notice
some most trustworthy guide, to show you what
you can’t help seeing if you follow your nose, and
are not blind&mdash;the said trustworthy guide paying
him a percentage on all grist thus sent
to his mill. Eventually, there would be a
high wall erected, and a locked gate, as at
the Turk Fall at Killarney, and a shilling to
pay for seeing “private property,” &amp;c. &amp;c. No,
no! let well alone. Give me the “Raven deep”
when it is in the silent solitudes of a Norwegian
forest, and let me muse wonderingly,
and filled with awe, at the stupendous engineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of Nature, and derive such edification as I may
from the sight.</p>

<p>At Sandok we get a fresh horse from the worthy
Oiesteen, and some capital beer, which he brings in
a wooden quaigh, containing about half a gallon.</p>

<p>On the face of the “loft,” loft or out-house, I
see an excellent specimen of wood carving.
“That,” said Oiesteen, “has often been pictured by
the town people.” All the farm-houses in this
part of the country used to be carved in this
fashion. One has only to read the Sagas to know
why all these old houses no longer exist. It is not
that the wood has perished in the natural way; experience,
in fact, seems to show that the Norwegian
pine is almost as lasting, in ordinary circumstances,
as stone, growing harder by age. The truth is, in
those fighting days of the Vikings, when one party
was at feud with another, he would often march all
night when his enemy least expected him, and
surrounding the house where he lay, so as to let
none escape, set it on fire.</p>

<p>The lad who took charge of the horse next
stage was called Björn (Bear), a not uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
name all over Norway. It was now evening,
and chilly.</p>

<p>“Are you cold, Björn?” said the student.</p>

<p>“No; the Björn is never chilly,” was the facetious
reply. The nearest approach to a witticism I had
ever heard escape the mouth of a Norwegian peasant.</p>

<p>Two or three miles to the right we descry the
river descending by a huge cataract from its birthplace
among the rocky mountains of Upper Thelemarken.
Presently we join what professes to be
the high road from Christiania, which is carried
some twenty miles further westward, and then
suddenly ceases.</p>

<p>Long after midnight, we arrived at the Rectory
House at &mdash;&mdash;, where I was to sleep. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
was an intelligent sort of person, very quiet and
affable, and dressed in homespun from head to foot.
After breakfast, the staple of which was trout from
the large lake close by, I offered him a weed, which
he declined, with the remark, “Ieg tygge,” I chew.
The ladies, as usual, are kind and unassuming,
with none of the female arts to be found in cities.
A friend of mine, proud of his fancied skill in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
talking Norsk, was once stopping at a clergyman’s
in Norway, when he apologised to the ladies for
his deficiencies in their language. He was
evidently fishing for compliments, and was considerably
taken aback when one of them, in the
most unsophisticated manner, observed, taking
him quite at his word, “Oh yes, strangers, you
know, often confound the words, and say one for
another, which makes it very difficult to comprehend
them.”</p>

<p>Ludicrous mistakes are sometimes made by the
Norwegians also. An English gentleman arrived
at a change-house in Österdal late one evening,
and was lucky in obtaining the only spare bed.
Presently, when he was on the point of retiring to
rest, a Norwegian lady also arrived, intending to
spend the night there. What was to be done?
Like a gallant Englishman as he was, with that
true, unselfish courtesy which is not, as in France,
confined to mere speeches, he immediately offered
to give up his bed to the “unprotected female,”
who was mistress of a little English. “Many
thanks; but what will you do, sir?” “Oh! I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
take a chair for the night.” At this answer the
lady blushed, and darted out of the room, and in
a few minutes her carriole was driving off in the
darkness. What could be the meaning of it?
The peasant’s wife soon after looked into the room,
with a knowing sort of look at the Englishman.
He subsequently discovered the key to the enigma.
The lady thought he said “he would take a <i>share</i>,”
and was, of course, mightily offended. So much
for a smattering of a foreign language. Doubtless,
from that day forward, she would quote this
incident to her female friends as an instance of
the natural depravity of Englishmen; and this
scapegrace would be looked upon as a type of his
nation.</p>

<p>The priest has some knives, the handles of
which are of ivory, and exquisitely carved in a
flowing pattern. They cost as much as three
dollars apiece, a great sum. But the artificer,
who lives near, is the best in Thelemarken, the
part of Norway most celebrated for this art. The
patterns used are, I hear, of very ancient date;
being, in some instances, identical with those on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
various metal articles discovered from time to
time in the barrows and cromlechs.</p>

<p>The walls of the sitting-room are hung with
some engravings on national subjects, <i>e.g.</i>, “Anna
Kolbjörnsdatter og de Svenske,” “Olaf, killed
at Sticklestad,” and “Konrad Adeler, at Tenedos.”
Kort Adeler, whose name lives in a popular song
by Ingemann, was born at Brevik, in 1622, but
took service under the Venetians, and on one
occasion fought and slew Ibrahim, the Turkish
admiral. Ibrahim’s sword and banner are still to
be seen at Copenhagen. Adeler’s successor, as
Norwegian Admiral, was the renowned Niels Juel,
the Nelson of the North.</p>

<p>I saw tossing about the Manse an old Runic
Calendar, which nobody seemed to care anything
about. It was found in the house when the
parson came there, and appeared occasionally to
have been used for stirring the fire, as one end was
quite charred. Without much difficulty I succeeded
in rescuing it from impending destruction,
and possess it at this moment. Some of these
calendars are shaped like a circle, others like an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ellipse. They were of two kinds. Messedag’s
stav (mass-day stave) and Primstav. But the
latter term properly applies to a much more complex
sort of calendar than the other. It contained
not only runes for festivals and other
days, but also the Sunday letter or quarters
of the moon for every golden number. Its name
is derived from prima luna, <i>i.e.</i>, the first full moon
after the vernal equinox. The primstav proper
was generally four feet long. The almanack I
here obtained is flat, and figured on two sides, not
as some of the old Anglo-Saxon calendars were,
square, and figured on four sides. It is shaped like
a flat sword, an inch and a half broad and half an
inch thick, and is provided with a handle. The
owner of it appears to have been born on the 6th
June, as his monogram which is on the handle occurs
again on that day. On the broad sides the days of
the week are notched, and on the narrow sides there
is a notch for every seventh day; <i>i.e.</i>, the narrow
sides mark the weeks, the broad sides the days.</p>

<p>The day-marks or signs do not go from January
to July, and from July to December. On the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
side, which was called the Vetr-leid, winter side, they
begin with the 14th of October, or “winter night,”
and reach to the 13th of April. On the other side,
which was called the summer side, they begin with
the 14th of April “summer night,” and go to the
13th of October. The runes, or marks distinguishing
the days, are derived from a variety of circumstances:
sometimes from the weather, or farming operations,
or from legends of saints. But it must be observed
that hardly two calendars can be found
corresponding to each other. Some are simpler,
others more complex. In some, one saint’s day
is distinguished, in others another. Winter then
began with the old Norwegians on the 14th of
October; Midwinter was ninety days after&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
on the 11th January, and Midsummer ninety-four
days from the 14th of April.</p>

<p>The great winter festival in honour of Thor, on
20th January, was called Höggenät, <i>i.e.</i>&mdash;slaughter-night.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
This word is derived from högge (to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or hew), on account of the number of animals
slaughtered in honour of Thor. The word still
survives in Scotland, in Hogmanáy (the last night
of the old year).</p>

<p>Snorro Sturlesen informs us that it was Hacon
the Good, foster-son of our King Athelstan, who
made a law that the great Asa, or heathen festival,
which used to be held for three successive days in
January, should be transferred to the end of
December, and kept so many days as it was usual
to keep Christmas in the English Church. His
missionaries being Northmen who had resided in
England, like St. Augustine, the Apostle of
England, accommodated themselves to the superstitions
and habits in vogue among the
people they came to convert. The great banquets,
where people feasted on the flesh of
horses and other victims, were turned into
eating and drinking bouts of a more godly
sort; and the Skaal to Odin assumed the shape
of a brimming bowl to the honour of the
Redeemer, the Virgin, and the saints. In their
cups, no doubt, their ideas would become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at times confused, and many a baptized heathen
would hiccup a health to Odin and Thor. Even
now, as we have seen, after the lapse of so many
centuries, much of the old heathen leaven infects
their Christianity.</p>

<p>We may here observe that the Norwegian word
for Saturday is Löverdag, <i>i.e.</i>, washing-day, as a preparation
for the Sunday festival, so that the division
of time into weeks of seven days must have originated
in Norway within the period of its conversion to
Christianity. Herein, then, they differed from the
Anglo-Saxons, who called it Sæterndæg (Saturns-day);
while the South Germans called it after the
Jewish Sabbath, Sambaztag, now Samstag. The
Scandinavians had exhausted their great gods upon
the other days. Sun and Moon, Tyr, Odin, Thor,
and Freya, had been used up, so they took the
appropriate name Löverdag, above-mentioned.</p>

<p>Some of these names are very appropriate, <i>e.g.</i>,
Gormánaðr is gore-month, when so many victims
were slaughtered. Ýlir, or Jýlir, is the month that
prepares for Yule. Mörsúgr refers to the good cheer
which people sucked up at that period. Þorri is said
to come from Þverra, to get short, because the good
things are then nearly run out. Gaukmánaðr
is Gauk’s (cuckoo’s) month. Sólmánaðr is the sun’s
month. Heyannir is hay-time. Tvimánaðr (from tvi,
two) is the second month after midsummer, while
Haustmánaðr is harvest (scotticè) “har’st” month.</p>

<p>But our readers will think us becoming prosy,
so we will mount the cart, and discarding the
society of the fat peasant woman who proposes
inflicting herself upon us, accept the kind offer of
our intelligent student to accompany us on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
journey to Kos-thveit (Kos-thwaite, as we should
say in East Anglia), on the Lake of Totak.</p>

<p>“Are there any songs current in the mouths of
the peasants here?” I inquired, as we drove very
slowly along a narrow road, through morasses,
studded with birch. “This is pre-eminently the
old fashioned part of Norway, so I suppose if they
are anywhere they are here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. There has been a student from
Christiania wandering about these parts lately,
collecting songs for the purpose of publication.
Many of them are dying out fast. Some years
ago, the girls used to improvise over the loom. At
weddings, lad and lass used to stevne (sing staves)
in amœbean fashion, on the spur of the moment.”</p>

<p>Some of these pieces are highly witty and satirical.
But the bonders are very averse to repeating
them. One of them, on being asked by the
student to repeat a stave, replied, “Ieg vil ikke
være en Narr for Byen-folk:” (I won’t play the
fool to amuse the city folks.)</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of one native to this part
done into English.</p>

</div>

<p>At Kos-thveit, on the lake Totak, stands a lone
farm-house, the proprietor of which procured me a
man and a maid to row me over the dreary waters,
now rendered drearier by a passing squall which
overcast the sky. Pointing to the westward, where
the lake narrowed, and receded under the shadows
of the approaching mountains, the ferryman told
me that yonder lay the famous Urebro Urden,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
where the god Thor, when disguised by beer, lost
his hammer, and cleared a road through the loose
rocks while engaged in searching for it. Indeed,
with the exception of Nissedal, in another part of
Thelemarken, which is reputed as the head quarters
of trolls and glamour, this gloomy lake and
its vicinity abound, perhaps more than any part of
Norway, in tales of Scandinavia’s ancient gods and
supernatural beings. The man also mentioned the
legend of Dyrë Vo, which has been put into verse
by Welhaven.</p>

<p>The following version will give some idea of the
legend&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The bonniest lad all Vinje thro’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was Dyrë of Vo by name,</div>
<div class="verse">Firm as a rock the strength, I trow,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of twelve men he could claim.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<div class="verse">“Well Dyrë,” quoth a neighbour bold,</div>
<div class="verse">“With trolls and sprites, like Thor of old,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To have a bout now fear ye?”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Not a bit, were it mirk,” said Dyrë.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Full soon, they tell, it did befal</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That in the merry Yule-tide,</div>
<div class="verse">When cups went round, and beards wagg’d all,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And the ale was briskly plied:</div>
<div class="verse">All in a trice the mirth grew still:</div>
<div class="verse">Hark! what a sound came from the hill,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As a hundred steers lowed near ye.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Well, now its right mirk,” quoth Dyrë.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then straightway he hied to Totak-vand,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And loosened his boat so snell;</div>
<div class="verse">But as he drew near to the other strand</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He heard an eldritch yell.</div>
<div class="verse">“Who’s fumbling in the churn? What ho!”</div>
<div class="verse">“But who art thou?&mdash;I’m Dyrë Vo,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">All in the moor, so weary;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And so dark as it is?” asked Dyrë.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I’m from Ashowe, and must away</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To Glomshowe to my lady;</div>
<div class="verse">Bring the boat alongside, and do not stay,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And put out your strength: so; steady.”</div>
<div class="verse">“You must shrink a bit first,” was Vo’s reply,</div>
<div class="verse">“My boat is so little, and you so high;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Your body’s as long as a tall fir-tree,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And, remember, its dark,” said Dyrë.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Troll he shrunk up, quite funny to see,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Ere the boat could be made to fit him,</div>
<div class="verse">Then Dyrë&mdash;the devil a pin cared he</div>
<div class="verse indent1">For Trolls&mdash;began to twit him.</div>
<div class="verse">“Now tell me, good sir, what giant you are.”</div>
<div class="verse">“No nonsense&mdash;you’ll rue it&mdash;of joking beware,”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Growled the Troll, so dark and dreary.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“Besides, it is mirk,” laughed Dyrë.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the Troll by degrees more friendly grew,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And said, when he over was ferried,</div>

<div class="verse">Look under the thwarts when darkness wanes,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">A trifle wherewith to make merry.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">“For now it is mirk,” said Dyrë.</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Very deep, sir,” said the boatman, as I let out
my spinning tackle, in the faint hopes of a trout
for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was the depth ever plumbed?” inquired I.</p>

<p>“To be sure, sir. That’s a long, long time ago&mdash;leastways,
I have heard so. There was an old
woman at Kos-thveit yonder, whose husband had
the ill-luck to be drowned in the lake. She set
people to work to drag for his body, but nowhere
on this side of the country could she get a rope
sufficiently long for the work. So she had to send
to the city for one. At last they reached the
bottom, and found the lake as deep as it was broad,
with a little to spare, for the rope reached from
Kos-thveit to Rauland, just across the water, and
then went twice round the church, which you see
standing alone, yonder on the shore, three miles
off.”</p>

<p>“Who serves that church?” inquired I.</p>

<p>“Vinje’s Priest,” he answered. “That was his
boat-house we passed.”</p>

<p>We landed on the eastern shore of the lake, at a
spot called Hadeland, where a cluster of farm-houses
were to be seen upon a green slope, showing
some symptoms of cultivation. Richard Aslackson
Berge, the farmer at whose house I put up, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
grimy, ill-clad fellow, quite astounded me by the
extent of his information. Catching sight of my
wooden calendar, he immediately fetched an old
almanack, which contained some explanation of the
various signs upon the staff. Fancy one of your
“alternate ploughboys”&mdash;as the Dean of Hereford
and other would-be improvers of the clod-hopping
mind, if I remember rightly, call them&mdash;fancy one
of these fellows studying with interest an ancient
Anglo-Saxon wooden calendar; and yet this man
Berge, besides this, talked of the older and younger
Edda, the poem of Gudrun, and, if my memory
serves me, of the Nibelungenlied. He had also
read the Heimskringla Saga. The promoters of
book-hawking and village lending libraries will be
interested to hear that this superior enlightenment
was due to a small lending library, which had been
established by a former clergyman of the district.
There was a pithiness and simplicity about this
man’s talk which surprised me.</p>

<p>“The wild geese,” says he, “come over here in
the spring, and after tarrying a few days make over
to the north, in the shape of a snow-plough.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Milton would have said, “Ranged in figure, wedge
their way.”</p>

<p>Several old swords and other weapons have been
dug up in the vicinity, indicative of rugged manners
and deeds quite in keeping with the rugged
features of the surrounding nature. On an old
beam in the hay-loft is carved, in antique Norsk&mdash;“Knut
So-and-so was murdered here in 1685”&mdash;the
simple memorial of a very common incident in
those days.</p>

<p>For the moderate sum of four orts (three and
fourpence) I hire a horse and a man to the shores
of the Miösvand. To the left of our route&mdash;path
there is none&mdash;is a place called Falke Riese (Falcon’s
Nest), where Richard tells me that his grandfather
told him he remembered a party of Dutchmen
being located in a log-hut, for the purpose of
catching falcons, and that they used duen (tame
doves) to attract them. This is interesting, as
showing the method pursued by the grandees of
Europe, in the days of hawking, to procure the
best, or Norwegian breed. At one time, this sport
was also practised by the great people of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
country. Thus, from Snorro, it appears that Eywind
used to keep falcons.</p>

<p>My guide, Ole, has been a soldier, but much
prefers the mountain air to that of the town.</p>

<p>“In the town,” says he, “it is so traengt,” (in Lincolnshire,
throng,) <i>i.e.</i>, no room to stir or breathe.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation he tells me he
verily believes I have travelled over the whole
earth.</p>

<p>While the horse is stopping to rest and browse
on a spot which afforded a scanty pasturage, a
likely-looking lake attracted my observation, and I
was speedily on its rocky banks, throwing for a
trout&mdash;but the trout were too wary and the water
too still. While thus engaged, a distant horn
sounds from a mountain on the right, sufficiently
startling in such a desolate region. Was game
afoot this morning, and was I presently to hear&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The deep-mouthed blood-hound’s heavy bay,</div>
<div class="verse">Resounding up the hollow way.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Game was afoot, but not of the kind usually the
object of the chase. The Alpine horn was blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
by a sæter-lad to keep off the wolves, as I was
informed. As nothing was to be done with the
rod, I tried the gun, and as we slope down through
the stunted willows and birch copses that patch
the banks of the Miösvand, I fall in with plenty
of golden plover and brown ptarmigan, and manage
to kill two birds with one stone. In other words,
the shots that serve to replenish the provision-bag
arouse a peasant on the further side, who puts
over to us in his boat, and thus saves us a detour
of some miles round the southern arm of the lake.
As we cross over, I perceive far to the westward
the snow-covered mountains of the Hardanger
Fjeld, which I hope to cross. The westernmost
end of the lake is, I understand, twenty-four
English miles from this. To the eastward, towering
above its brother mountains, is the cockscombed
Gausta, which lies close by the Riukan
Foss, while all around the scenery is as gaunt and
savage as possible. At Schinderland, where we
land, after some palaver I procure a horse to
Erlands-gaard, a cabin which lies on the hither
side of the northern fork of the Miösen, said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
seven miles distant. But the many detours we had
to make to avoid the dangerous bogs, made the
transit a long affair. In one place, when the poor
nag, encumbered with my effects, sank up to his
belly, I expected every moment to see the hungry
bog swallow him up entirely. With admirable
presence of mind he kept quite still, instead of
exhausting himself in struggling, and then by an
agile fling and peculiar sleight of foot, got well
out of the mess.</p>

<p>The delay caused by these difficulties enabled
me to bring down some more ptarmigan, and have
a bang at an eagle, who swept off with a sound
which to my ears seemed very like “don’t you wish
you may get it.” But perhaps it was only the wind
driving down the rocks and over the savage moorland.</p>

<p>The modest charge of one ort (tenpence), made by
my guide for horse and man, not a little surprised
me. I did not permit him to lose by his honesty.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the boat at Erlands-gaard is away;
so meanwhile I cook some plover and chat with
the occupants of the cabin. Sigur Ketilson, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the sons, is a Konge-man, (one of “the king’s
men,” or soldiers, mentioned in the ballad of
“Humpty-dumpty.”) He has been out exercising
this year at Tönsberg, one hundred and forty
English miles off. The mere getting thither to
join his corps is quite a campaign in itself. On
his road to headquarters he receives fourteen
skillings per diem as <i>viaticum</i>, and one skilling and
a half for “<i>logiment</i>.” A bed for three farthings!
He is not forced to march more than two Norsk
(fourteen English) miles a day. The time of
serving is now cut down one-half, being five instead
of ten years, and by the same law every able-bodied
person must present himself for service, though
instead of the final selection being made by lot, it
is left to the discretion of one officer&mdash;a regulation
liable to abuse.</p>

<p>At last the boat returns, and embarking in it by
ten o’clock <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, when it is quite dark, I arrive at
the lone farm-house at Holvig. Mrs. Anna Holvig
is reposing with her three children, her husband
being from home. There being only one bed on
the premises, I find that the hay this night must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
be my couch. The neighbouring loft where I slept
was a building with its four ends resting, as usual,
on huge stones. At intervals during the night I
am awoke by noises close to my ear, which I
thought must be from infantine rats, whose organs
of speech were not fully developed. In the morning
I discover that my nocturnal disturbers were not
rats, but swallows, who had constructed their mud
habitations just under the flooring where I slept.
“The swallow twittering from its straw-built nest”
may gratify persons of an elegiac turn; but under the
circumstances the noise was anything but agreeable.</p>

<p>“The breezy call of incense breathing morn,”
in which the same poet revels, was much more to
my liking; indeed, one sniff of it made me as fresh
as a lark, and I picked my way to the house by the
lake side, and enjoyed my coffee. The little boy,
Oiesteen Torkilson, though only eight years of
age, has not been idle, and has procured a man and
horse from a distant sæter. The price asked is out
of all reason, as I don’t hesitate to tell the owner.
Before the bargain is struck, I jot down a few
remarks in my journal. With the inquisitiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of her nation, the woman asks what I am writing.
“Notices of what I see and think of the people;
who is good, and who not.” Out bolts the lady,
to apprise the man of her discovery that “there’s
a chield amang ye taking notes, and faith he’ll
print it.” My device succeeded. Presently she
finished her confab with the peasant, and returned to
say that he would take a more moderate payment.</p>

<p>I observed here, for the first time, the difference
between the two words “ja” and “jo.”</p>

<p>Have you seen a bear?&mdash;“Ja.” Haven’t you
seen a bear?&mdash;“Jo.” I have met educated Norwegians
who had failed to observe the distinction.
A perfectly similar distinction was formerly made
in England between “yes” and “yea.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The path, I find, is at a higher level than I
imagined, for, on reaching a sæter, no bunker (sour
milk, with a thick coating of cream) is to be had,
as the temperature is too low, the girl tells me, for
the process of mantling to take place.</p>

<p>The horse being exceedingly lazy, I administered
a rebuke to him, when he was not slow in returning
the compliment, striking me with his heels in the
thigh. Luckily I was close behind him, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
thread of my story might have been abruptly
snapped.</p>

<p>Pine now begins to take the place of birch, and
we descend very rapidly into the valley of the
Maan, pronounced Moan. To our right, among
the trees, is heard the roar of the famous Riukan
foss, which at one perpendicular shoot of nine
hundred feet, discharges the waters of the great
Miösvand and other lakes into the valley.</p>

<p>Leaving my guide to rest for a space, I plunged
into the forest, and, after a precipitous descent,
espy a cottage close to the falls. Here sat two
strangers, regaling themselves on wild strawberries
and milk, while the master of the hut was carving
a wooden shoe, and the mistress suckling a baby.
The travellers both wore spectacles and longish hair,
and a pocket-compass depending from their necks.
Each carried a <i>beau ideal</i> of a knapsack, and I knew
them at once to be German students. After eating
their meal, they observed that they had “yut
yespeist,” which stamped them at once to be from
the Rhine; the pronunciation of <i>g</i> as <i>y</i> being the
shibboleth of detection. “Eine <i>y</i>ute <i>y</i>ebratene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<i>y</i>ans ist eine <i>y</i>ute <i>y</i>abe <i>Y</i>oddes” (a yood yoast
yoose is a yood yift of Yod), is a saying fastened
on the Rhinelander by the more orthoepic Hanoverian.
But it is more than doubtful whether these
good people will have any opportunity in this
country of tasting any such delicacy.</p>

<p>A few yards brought us to the magnificent
amphitheatre of the Riukan, on the further side of
which we have the fall full in view. On the face
of the smooth, nearly perpendicular wall which
shuts in the vast arena to the right of us, is an
exceedingly narrow ledge&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A bridge of dread,</div>
<div class="verse">Not wider than a thread&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">along which foolhardy people have occasionally
risked their necks, either out of mere bravado or
in order to make a short cut to the Miösvand,
which I left this morning. This is the famous
Mari-stien&mdash;everybody knows the legend about it&mdash;sadly
exemplifying the fact that the course of true
love never did run smooth: how young Oiesteen
fell from it on his way to a stolen interview with
Mary of Vestfjordalen, and she lost her senses in
consequence, and daily haunted the spot for years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
afterwards, pale and wan, and silent as a ghost,
and is even now seen when the shades of evening
fall, hovering over the giddy verge of “The remorseless
deep which closed o’er the head of her
loved Lycidas.”</p>

<p>But as neither I nor the Teutons could see
any possible good in risking our necks for nought,
and valued a whole skin and unbroken bones, after
assaying to take in and digest the wonderful sight,
we presently retraced our steps without setting foot
on ledge.</p>

<p>Five miles below this is Dœl, where some accommodation,
at a dear rate, is to be obtained of
Ole Tarjeison.</p>

<p>Next morning, the summit of Gausta, which rises
just over the Maan to the height of 5688 feet, and
commands a magnificent view of the district of
Ringerike, is covered with cloud. But what is bad
weather to others, is good in the eyes of the fisherman.
So, instead of lamenting “the wretched
weather,” I get out my trout-rod and secure some
capital trouts (at times they are taken here seven
pounds in weight), part of which I have sprinkled
with salt, and put into the provision-bag, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
view to the journey I purpose taking from hence
across the Fjeld to Norway’s greatest waterfall, the
Vöringfoss, in the Hardanger.</p>

<p>While sauntering about, a printed notice, suspended
in the passage of the house, attracts my
attention, which afforded a considerable insight
into the morals of the Norwegian peasant. It was
dated April 18, 1853, and was to this effect: The
king has heard with much displeasure that the old
custom of young unmarried men running about at
night, sometimes in flocks (flokkeviis), especially
on Sundays and saints’-days, after the girls, while
asleep in the cow-houses, has been renewed. His
Majesty, therefore, summons all Christian and
sober-minded parents, and house-fathers, to protect
their children and servants from this nocturnal
rioting. He also calls upon them to keep the two
sexes apart, for the sake of order and good morals;
and if the same shall be detected conniving at
these irregularities, they shall, for the first offence,
be mulcted one dollar seventy-two skillings; for the
second offence, double that amount, &amp;c. The
young men shall have the same punishment; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for the third offence, be confined from three to six
months with hard labour in a fortress. Girls who
receive such clandestine visits, shall be punished
in like manner. Informers shall be entitled to
receive the fine. All Government officers are required
to make known these presents. This notice
must be read at churches, posted in conspicuous
places, and sent about by messengers.</p>

<p>Here, then, I obtained the certain knowledge of
a custom&mdash;similar to one which still lingers in
Wales&mdash;which I had suspected to be prevalent,
but the existence of which the inhabitants of the
country, for some reason or other, I found slow to
admit. The above ordinance is a renewal of a
similar one made 4th March, 1778, from which it
appears that the immorality of “Nattefrieri” (night-courting)
has long prevailed in Norway.</p>

<p>Eight English miles below this the Maan finds
ample room and verge enough to expatiate in the
deep Tindsö, which is, perhaps, one of the most
dangerous lakes in Norway, being subject to frightfully
sudden storms; while the precipitous
cliffs that bound it, for the most part only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
afford foothold to a fly, or such like climbers.
There is an old tale about this lake, illustrative
of the dangers to which a clergyman is
subject in the discharge of his duties. Many
years ago, the parson of the parish had to cross
over the lake to do duty in the “annex church” at
Hovind. The weather was threatening; but his
flock awaited him, and so he started, commending
himself to God and his good angels. Long before
he approached his destination, the wind had so
increased in violence that the boatmen were overpowered,
and the boat was dashed to pieces against
the adamantine walls of the Haukanes Fjeld. All
on board were lost but the priest, who was carried
by the billows into a small cleft in the rock, far
above the usual high-water mark. For three days
he sat wedged in this hole, from whence there was
no exit. On the fourth day, the winds and waves
abated; and some boatmen, who were rowing
by, as good fortune would have it, heard the
faint cry for assistance which the captive
gave, as he saw them from his “coin of vantage.”
And so he was rescued from his terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
predicament; and the notch in the wall still
goes by the name of the Prestehul, “Priest’s-hole.”</p>

<p>Bishop Selwyn, with his well-found yacht, sailing
among the deep bays of New Zealand, confirming
and stablishing the Maoris in the Christian faith,
will have to wait a long time before he can meet
with such an adventure as the Tindsö priest. But
then you’ll say, in winter time it is all right, and
the parson can dash along over the ice, defying the
dangers of the deep and the bristling rocks. Not
so, however; there are not unfrequently weak
places in the ice, which look as strong as the rest,
but which let in the unfortunate traveller. Not
long ago, five men and a horse were thus engulphed.
So in the Heimskringla Saga, King
Harold and his retinue perish by falling through
the ice on the Randsfjord, at a place where cattle-dung
had caused it to thaw.</p>

<p>Giving up all thoughts of ascending the Gausta,&mdash;as
I understand the chance of a view from it in
this misty weather is very precarious,&mdash;I hire a
horse from one Hans Ostensen Ingulfsland, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
convey my luggage to Waage, on the Miösvand.
Hans was ill, apparently of a deranged stomach
and liver, and, with rueful aspect, consulted me on
his case. All the medicine he had was what he
called a <i>probatum</i>, in a small bottle. The probatum
turned out to be a specific for the gravel, as I saw
from a label on the flask; so I gave him what
was more likely to suit his case, some blue pill and
rhubarb.</p>

<p>Hans’ father used to entertain travellers, but his
charges became so high that all his customers
forsook him; and M. Doel, who appears to be in a
fair way to imitate his predecessor, set up in “the
public line.”</p>

<p>Hitherto the valley has been clear of cloud;
and on arriving at Vaa, I stop to rest, and sketch
the distant smoke of the Riukan ascending from
its rocky cauldron towards heaven. Presently the
mist, which had all the morning hidden the
“comb” of Gausta, threw off a few flakes; these
gradually extend and unite, and pour along the
mountain-tops to my left, and in a few minutes
reach to and absorb the smoke of Riukan, and hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it from view. Up boil the fogs, as if by magic,
from all sides; and, like the image of Fame, in
<i>Virgil</i>, the vapour rises from the depths of the
valley, and reaches up to the sky. Doubtless it
was the spirit of the place, wroth at my profane
endeavour to represent her shrine on paper; and
the sullen “moan” of the stream might, by an imaginative
person, have been supposed to be the
utterance of her complaint.</p>

<p>In the foreground, intently watching my operations
as he sits upon a rock, is old Peer Peerson
Vaa, who being over eighty, is past work, and
having no children, has sold his Gaard to one Ole
Knutzen, on the condition of having his liv-brod
(life-bread)&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, being supported till his death.
This is not an uncommon custom in Norway. He
is “farbro” (uncle) to the man at Dœl.</p>

<p>Observe the simplicity of the language. So
the Norsk for “aunt” is “moerbro,”&mdash;mother’s
brother.</p>

<p>I here obtain a dollar or two of small change,
with which I am ill provided. It is curious,
by-the-bye, to see how one of these bonders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
looks at half-a-dozen small coins before he is
able to reckon the amount. This is in consequence
of the infrequency of money up the country.</p>

<p>As we ascend the Pass, I observe some dusky-looking
birds, which turn out to be ringouzels.
According to a Norwegian whom I consulted on
the subject, they are the substitute, in a great
measure, if not altogether, in this part of the
country, for the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ouzel cock, so black of hue,</div>
<div class="verse">With orange-tawny bill,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whose plaintive song so delights us in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Several fieldfares, also, chattered in a startled
and angry manner as they rose from the low birch
bushes, impatient, no doubt, for the period, now
fast approaching, when their young ones will be
ready to fly and start for Germany, one of their
chief winter <i>habitats</i>, where, under the appellation
of “Krammets-vogel,” they will appear in the bill
of fare at the hotels. What an odd notion, to be
sure, of all these birds going so far to lie-in! What
an infinity of trouble they would save themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
if they stopped, for instance, during the breeding
period, in Germany or England! Aye; but then
they would be exposed to the depredations of “Tom
Brown” and others of the genus schoolboy, whose
destructive and adventurous qualities generally
first develop themselves in the bird-nesting line.</p>

<p>One of the straps which fastened my luggage to
the horse having broken, my guide very soon constructs,
of birch twig, a strap and buckle which
holds as fast as any leathern one I ever saw. This
fertility of invention is due to the non-division of
labour. What could an Englishman have done
under similar circumstances?</p>

<p>Halvor Halvorsen, my guide, is a poor weakly
fellow, and having seen me prescribe for Ingulfsland,
he asks me if I can do anything for him.
Good living and less hard work are all he wants;
but, unfortunately, while he has plenty of the latter,
he gets but little of the former. On his back is a
great load of milk-pails, and some provisions
(potatoes and flad-brod) for his spouse, who is
taking care of a sæter, which we shall pass.</p>

<p>At length we arrive there: it is a cot of unhewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
stone-slabs, and before the door a lot of dried
juniper-bushes, the only firing which the desolate
plateau affords. Gro Johannsdatter, a really pretty-looking
young woman, with delicate features, smiles
in a subdued manner as we enter, and thanks her
husband quietly and monosyllabically for bringing
up the food. This, together with her little boy, she
proceeds to examine with inquisitive, eager eye.
The larder was doubtless nearly empty. She then
gives her husband, whom she had not seen for
some time, a furtive look of affection, but nothing
more&mdash;no embrace, no kiss. How undemonstrative
these people are! It is a remarkable characteristic
of the lower orders of Norway, that, unlike
their betters, they never think of kissing or embracing
before strangers. Compare this with those
demonstrations in Germany and France, where
not the opposite sexes, but great bearded men, will
kiss each other on either cheek with the report of
popguns, regardless of bystanders.</p>

<p>Presently they go into the inner compartment of
the hut, and then at length I believe I heard the
sound of a kiss. While she makes up the fire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
boils some milk for her husband, who has many
hours of mountain still before him, I endeavour
to take a slight sketch of her and the abode.</p>

<p>No sooner does she become aware of my intentions,
than, with true feminine instinct, she begs
me to wait a moment, while she divests herself of
an ugly clout of a kerchief which hides a very
pretty neck. The sketch concluded, she asks for
a sight of it, and, with a pleased smile, exclaims,
“No, no; I’m not so smuk (pretty, smug) as
that.”</p>

<p>These châlets, by-the-bye, are not called sæter
in this part of Norway, but stol, or stöl. They
are very inferior in accommodation to those in
the Hardanger district and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Beyond crossing a river, Humle-elv, when, by
my guide’s recommendation, I spring on the
horse’s back, I find nothing noted in my diary
concerning the rest of the day’s journey.</p>

<p>These little horses will carry up and down
steep mountains from fifteen Norwegian Bismark
lbs. (nearly two hundred weight English) up to
twenty-two. How the little nag, with my luggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and myself on his back, managed to win his way
over the stream, which was at least two feet deep,
and among the large slippery stones on its
bottom, it was difficult to divine. They are very
cats for climbing, though they do not share that
animal’s aversion to water, which they take to
as if it was their natural element.</p>

<p>It was already dark when we emerged from the
morasses and loose rocks, and lighted by good
luck on the little patch of green sward on the
northern shores of the Misövand, adjoining the
farm-house of Waagen. On referring to the map,
reader, and finding this spot set down upon it,
your imagination, of course, pictures a regular
village, or something of that sort; but this is
not the case. A couple of gaards, with a belt of
swampy grass land, are all the symptoms of man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to enliven this intensely solitary waste of grey
rocks, bog, birch, and water.</p>

<p>The proprietors are Gunnuf Sweynsen and his
brother Torkil, together with one Ole Johnson,
a cousin. Gunnuf is absent, guiding the Germans
across the Fjeld.</p>

<p>The best method to proceed is, I find, to take
boat from here to Lien, which is about twenty-four
miles distant, at the very top or north-eastern
end of the lake; a horse must then be procured
to carry my effects for the other seventy English
miles across the mountains. A bargain is soon
struck with Johnson, who has once before traversed
most of the route; and for the sum of eight
dollars (thirty-six shillings English) he undertakes
to horse and guide me the whole way to the
Hardanger.</p>

<p>The stabur, or hay-loft, affords me a tolerable
night’s resting-place. There were no women-folk
about to make things comfortable; so I managed
with the three unkempt <i>valets de chambre</i> instead,
who boiled me some coffee, greased my boots, and
did the needful quite as well as one of those short-jacketed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
napkin-carrying, shilling-seeking German
kellners who supersede the spruce chamber-maid
of the English inn.</p>

<p>By early day we walk across the dew-dank
meadow down to the shore of the lake, while a
few black ducks, which scuttle off at our approach,
warn me to get my fowling-piece ready. The
water is so shallow near the land, that the boat
gets aground; and the men are in the water in a
moment and pushing her off, and into the boat
again in a twinkling as she shot into the deeps,
the water streaming from their legs in cascades,
about which they seemed to care as little as the
black ducks aforesaid.</p>

<p>As we glide out into the offing, my spinning-tackle
is got out, as I determine to improve the
opportunity, and see what the lake can boast of
in the way of fish. A banging trout is soon fixed
on the deadly triangles which garnishes the sides
of the bright metal minnow, to the great delight
of the boatmen, to whom the operation is
entirely novel.</p>

<p>Take warning, piscatorial reader, from me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mind you use a plaited line with spinning-tackle.
In my hurry I had used a fine twisted one, which
kinked up into a Gordian knot the moment it
was slack, and I lost some time in getting out
another line.</p>

<p>Yonder, on the western shore of the lake,
standing in the midst of the silent wilderness,
rises the solitary house of God where the people
of these parts worship, its humble spire of wood
reflected on the surface of the lake. With the
exception of Hovden Church and our boat, the
waters and shores exhibit nothing else indicative
of the proximity of man.</p>

<p>The congregation must be a very scattered one,
for if ever people dwelt few and far between, it
is in these solitudes. Not one of the three
clergymen of the parishes of Vinje, Sillejord, and
Tind, who share in the Sunday duty which is
performed here a dozen times a year, can live
under fifty miles off. A Diocesan Spiritual Aid
Society is certainly wanted in these regions.</p>

<p>Such words as “hyre,” to hire; “ede,” to eat;
“beite,” to bite; “aarli,” early, let drop by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
boatmen in the course of conversation, remind
me that I am in a part of the country where a
portion of the old tongue still keeps its ground,
such as it was when brought over to England,
and engrafted on its congener, the Anglo-Saxon,
nearly a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Quite a tempest of wind now suddenly springs
up, sending us along at a great pace, and rendering
it difficult, when I now and then caught a
trout by the tackle trailing astern, to lay-to and
secure the fish. The twenty-four miles were soon
behind us, and we found ourselves in the Quenna
river. “Ducks ahead!” was the cry of the lively
Torkil, and my fowling-piece soon added fowl to
the fish. No fear of starvation now, even though
the larder at Lien prove to be empty.</p>

<p>As it is some hours to nightfall, I rig my fly-rod,
and try the pools of the Quenna. Some fat,
cinnamon-coloured flies, which I found reposing
under the stones, being hardly yet strong enough
on the wing to disport themselves aloft, gave
me a hint as to the sort of fly that would go down,
and, my book containing some very similar insects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I had no lack of sport, securing several nice
fish. They do run as large as five pounds, I hear.</p>

<p>On returning to the small farm-house where I
was to spend the night, a horse, I found, had been
procured; and as a beautiful evening gave promise
of a fine day on the morrow, we prepared to
start by earliest dawn. My bed of skins was, as
usual, laid in the hay-shed; and I retired in the
highest possible spirits at the prospect of crossing
the desolate and grand mountain-plateau that separates
us from the western shores of Norway.</p>

<p>As this spot stands at an elevation of some
three thousand feet above the sea, there were no
pine-trees growing near; so the shed was constructed
of undressed birch poles, and was about
as weather-tight as a blackbird’s wicker cage. The
chinks near my pillow I stopped up with loose hay.
Vain precaution! Before dawn I awoke, cold and
stiff. The weather had changed; my sleeping-chamber
was become a very temple of the winds,
and the storm made a clean breach through the
tenement, having swept out the quasi-oakum which
I had stuffed into the crevices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>On issuing from my dormitory, I found the weather
was frightful. A deluge of rain, and wind,
and thick mist filled the space between earth and
sky. To attempt the passage of the Fjeld was not
to be thought of, as there is no road whatever.
Departure, therefore, being out of the question, I
made up my mind to another day’s sojourn at the
cottage, which was the most comfortless, dirty
spot I ever met with in Thelemarken; and that
is saying a good deal. During the day, most of
the natives&mdash;Ole, my guide, among the rest&mdash;were
away at the châlet. Besides myself, there were
only two other persons left at home; and these,
as my journey is at a stand-still, I may as well
describe.</p>

<p>A tall, old man, his height bowed by the weight
of more than eighty years, sat in a kubbe-stol&mdash;a
high backed chair, made out of a solid trunk of
tree, peculiar to Thelemarken&mdash;warming his knees
at the fire in the corner, and mumbling to himself.
Presently he lay down on a bench, and snored.
Before long up he got, and spooned up a quantity
of cold porridge; and then, turning his bleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
eyes at me, as I sat finishing a sketch of the interior
of the dwelling, including himself, croaked
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Er du Embedsman?” (Art thou a Government
servant?)</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s odd.”</p>

<p>And then he commenced warming his knees
and mumbling, and then snored as before, extended
on the bench; and before long, rose and
spooned up porridge. These were his daily and
hourly avocations. His name was a grand one&mdash;Herrbjörn
Hermanson&mdash;but the owner of it was
disgusting. No wonder; he never washes at all,
so that the appearance of his countenance may
be conceived. When he departs this life he will
undergo ablution.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of this, in the absence of a better
occupation, I gave a classic turn to the affair, and
in my thoughts altered a line of Juvenal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Pars bona <i>Norwegiæ</i> est, si verum admittimus, in qua</div>
<div class="verse">Nemo sumit <i>aquam</i> nisi mortuus.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That I don’t think is a libel. Indeed, with “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wretchlessness of most unclean living”&mdash;this application
of the words of the Seventeenth Article
is not mine, but a late geological Dean of Westminster’s,
in his sermon on the cholera&mdash;the inhabitants
of this country generally have a very
practical acquaintance.</p>

<p>The other person who kept at home all day, was
a young fellow of thirty, with swarthy face and
gleaming eyes. His dark, shaggy head of hair was
surmounted by a cap like that worn by the Finns,
with a bunch of wild flowers stuck in a red band
that encircled it. His dress was a short jacket,
skin knee-breeches, and jack-boots. His time was
occupied between smearing the boots with reindeer
fat, sharpening a knife of formidable dimensions,
and casting small bullets; while ever and
anon he would repair to a small looking-glass of
three inches square, hung against the wall, and
contemplate a very forbidding, peculiar set of
features therein. There was something uncanny
about the look of the fellow which I did not much
relish. Presently he takes my pipe from the table,
and coolly commences smoking it. Subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I find that Joh is not as other men are, and only
half in possession of his senses.</p>

<p>Some twenty years ago tame reindeer were
introduced upon these mountains from Finmark,
and great things were expected from the importation;
but the enterprize did not answer; and a
couple of years ago the proprietors slaughtered all
the deer, and there was a great merry-making at a
farm called Norregaard on the occasion. Deep
drinking was the order of the day; raw potato
brandy was gulped down in profuse quantities. For
forty-eight hours without intermission did the bout
continue. Like Paddy’s noddle in respect to the
shillelagh, most of these mountaineers’ heads are
proof against the knock-me-down power of strong
alcohol. Not so Joh’s, who was one of the party;
in the midst of the festivities he lost his reason,
and went stark staring mad. It was long before
he quieted down; since then he has never done
any work, or shared in the labours of the rest of
the family; nothing will persuade him, however,
to touch brantviin now. The burnt child dreads
the fire&mdash;the brandy must formerly have had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
fearful fascination for him. I drew a cork from a
small flask with me; the moment the sound caught
his ear, his face whirled round to where I sat with the
rapidity of an automaton, and he glared a look of
peculiar meaning at me from underneath his heavy
eyebrows, which at the time I could not comprehend.</p>

<p>But though he is averse to all regular work,
there is one thing I find on which he spares no
pains,&mdash;reindeer stalking. This is the occupation
on which he starts day after day, without speaking
a word to the rest of the household; in season and
out of it, he is continually alone on the mountains
around. Outside the door are a dozen pairs of
antlers, the trophies of his skill. Only last week
he shot a female deer, the fifth or sixth this
summer, although the season fixed by law has not
yet arrived. But he is out of the ken of
informers.</p>

<p>Drying on the wall outside is a rein-skin, and in
the house are two or three hides which his ingenuity
has converted into leather. His boots are of that
material&mdash;so are his knee-breeches. He is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
absent for days on the mountain, not unfrequently
sleeping under a rock. If he discovers a flock of
deer in a spot where the nature of the ground will
not permit of his getting within shot, he bides till
they move, dodging about unperceived. Not long
since, he killed two specimens of the Fjeld-frass, or
glutton, whose scent is said to be incredibly keen,
nosing wounded game miles off. One of these
wretches he saw track and catch and kill a wounded
(skamskudt) deer; and while it was thus occupied
he stole upon it unawares, and became possessed
of deer and glutton both.</p>

<p>At all events, he showed more gumption on this
occasion than an English parson with whom I am
acquainted. One day he saw that diminutive
British equivalent to the glutton&mdash;a weazel&mdash;pursuing
similar tactics&mdash;overtake an unfortunate
hare. As usual, poor puss was fascinated, and her
legs refused their office in the way of flight; but
each time the ferocious little creature tried to
fasten upon her, she knocked it over with her paws,
jumping at it and pushing it over. Off set the
parson, not to smash the brute with his cane, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to tell his Grace’s keeper. It is needless to add,
that when he returned with that functionary the
vampire quadruped had got on the hare’s neck, and
sucked all the blood out of its veins, managing to
get clean off to boot.</p>

<p>But to return to Joh. Observing me engaged
in frying trout, he suddenly exclaims&mdash;the first
word he had spoken&mdash;“Kann De spise reen?” (can
you eat reindeer?) “To be sure.” Upon which
he bolted out of the hut, and soon returned with a
lump of venison weighing perhaps four pounds,
which he silently placed on the board. It was
evident to me that Joh was a person of capabilities;
and I soon got him to work, repairing my knapsack
and gun-case. A few artificial flies, of which he
was not slow in comprehending the meaning, rewarded
his endeavours in the saddler’s art.</p>

<p>Towards evening the family returned from the
sæter,&mdash;two strapping maidens, Kari and Gunhild,
among the number. The occupation in which
some of the party forthwith engaged&mdash;the mystery
or craft of making flad-brod, the national esculent&mdash;soon
drove me into the fresh air. At a table sits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
one of the girls, roller in hand, busily engaged in
rolling out huge flat cakes of dough, sprinkling them
with water by means of a little brush. The Alfred of
the occasion was the father of Joh, who, with a sort
of trowel, whips up the cakes, and flaps them down
on the girdle-iron, a flat disk, about three-quarters
of a yard in diameter. At the proper moment he
gives them a turn, and in a minute they are done,
and whisked into the hands of the other girl, who
piles them on a table. The girdle-iron being large,
the smoke is prevented ascending the chimney in
its natural way, and becomes dissipated all over the
one sitting-room of the house, and this it is that
drives me out of it.</p>

<p>This favourite food is sometimes prepared in
sufficient quantities for a whole winter’s consumption.
I have seen, in a large gaard, nearly a dozen
Abigails hard at work kneading, sprinkling, rolling,
and baking the cakes. The only time when they
are endurable to the palate, in my opinion, is when
they are just warm off the fire. When warm, they
are flexible, and are then folded up compactly, if
wanted for travelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Another national cake, something like a pikelet
in taste and consistency, is the waffel-kage, which
is about half an inch thick, oblong, and moulded
into squares; this is by no means to be despised.</p>

<p>I was early down among the hay for the purpose
of recruiting my vital energies for the morrow,
when our work was cut out for us, and plenty of
it. The interstices between the bars of the cage
were weather-tightened afresh, and I was resolved
to be as cosy and comfortable as circumstances
would permit. Neither the French nor the Germans
have any word to represent that very pleasant
accident of our being, which we call comfort;
so they borrow the word and its derivatives out
and out from our English vocabulary when they
desire to express a thing, which, after all, they
cannot possibly have experienced practically. Only
fancy, then, the Norwegians presuming to think
of such a phase of existence. And yet they
have a word said to answer exactly to our word
“comfortable,”&mdash;viz., “hyggelig,” from hygge;
which is, no doubt, identical with our word “to
hug,” or embrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyhow, my efforts to be “hyggelig” were not
successful that night. Like the Grecian hero
under different circumstances, I could not rest; no
wonder, therefore, I was up and stirring early;
indeed, I had been stirring all night. The sun
shone out brightly, every leaf and blade of grass
and rock reflecting his rays from their moist
surfaces. The rain had ceased falling from the
clouds, but not from the mountains. The river
was brimful and roaring fiercely, the toying
cascades of twenty-four hours ago now swollen
into blustering cataracts, while fresh ones were
improvised for the occasion. But, alas! I
was ill fitted for enjoying the glorious scene.
Ague-fits shot through my limbs and frame; and
even before we started, I felt as if I had already
travelled many miles.</p>

<p>It was clear I had caught cold, if nothing worse;
but there was no help for it. The very idea of
stopping another day in this den, with Joh and
Herrbjörn for my companions, was intolerable.
Seventy miles, it is true, lay before me, and not a
house on the route. Behind me it was a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fifty miles back to civilized life, and double or
treble that distance to a doctor. “Nulla retrorsum,”
too, is my motto, unless things come
to such a pass as they did with Havelock’s men
on the road to Lucknow. The upshot was that I
trusted in Providence, and set my breast manfully
to the mountain, supported by that inward consciousness
of endurance so dear to a Briton, which
every now and then tried to express itself, comically
enough, by feebly humming “There’s life in the
old dog yet.”</p>

<p>Leaving the angry Quenna, we struck northward
up a gradual ascent of rock, polished apparently
by former rains, its surface fissured at intervals
by deep cracks, and dabbed with patches of yellow
moss, dwarf birch, and glaucous willow, but, for
the most part, fortunately affording capital walking
ground. A covey of grey ptarmigan, a snipe or
two, and some golden plover, rose before us; but
I felt so weak and ill that I had not the heart to load
my fowling-piece, which the little horse bore, along
with my other effects, attached to the straddle.</p>

<p>As we journey along, a distant neigh (in Thelemarken
speech “neija,” in Norwegian, “vrinske,”)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
reaches my ear, and I descry three colts bounding
down the rocks to us. On joining our party,
seemingly tired of the loneliness of the mountain,
and delighted at the idea of a new equine companion,
they dance round our little nag in most
frolicksome mood. In spite of all we can do to
prevent them, they stick to us, now in front, now
alongside, now at our rear. At this moment a
man’s voice is heard, and a wild figure in frieze
jacket, of the true Thelemarken cut, knee-breeches,
and bare calves, rushes up breathless. “Well,
Ambrose,” said my guide, “I thought they were
yours, but they would follow us. We couldn’t stop
them.” Indeed, Ambrose found the task equally
difficult. He had never taken lessons from Mr.
Rarey. It was only by seizing the ringleader by
his forelock, and hanging heavily with the other
arm on his neck, he managed to turn him from the
error of his way, which would most likely have
only terminated with our day’s journey’s end.</p>

<p>“And who is Ambrose?” inquired I. “Where
is his Stöl? I see no symptoms of one.”</p>

<p>“Stöl! bless you, langt ifra (far from it). He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is a flytte-maend. He comes up on the mountain
with a lot of horses and Nöd (Scoticè nowt,
horned cattle), for about six weeks in the summer.
He has a bag of meal, and he lives upon that and
the milk of one milking cow, which he has with
him. At night, he sleeps under a rock or stone,
flitting about from place to place, wherever he can
find grass for the cattle. He receives a small sum
a head for his trouble, when he has taken them
back safe and sound.”</p>

<p>Hard life of it, thought I. Bad food and worse
lodging; not to mention that the beasts of prey
occasionally diminish the number of his charge,
and with it the amount of his earnings.</p>

<p>After toiling along for twenty English miles of
treeless wilderness, skirting several lakes, floundering
through many bogs, and sitting on the horse
as he forded one or two rivers, we reached a knoll,
which the guide called Grodhalse. It was a curious
spot: itself green and smiling with grassy herbage;
behind it, higher up the slope, patches of unmelted
snow; while at our feet ran a rill of snow-water.</p>

<p>“We must qvile (<i>i.e.</i>, while = rest) here a bit,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
said Ole. “There is no other grass to be found
for many miles.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, light a fire in a moment,” said
I, a cold shudder running through me the
very moment I stood still, and I at once enveloped
myself in my pea-coat, buttoning the
collar over my ears. “Fill that kettle with water,
and have it boiling as soon as ever you can. Here
are some matches.” The green prickly juniper scrub,
which he forthwith dragged up by the roots, soon
blazed up with the proverbially transient crackling
of fire among the thorns; and the little copper kettle
which I had prudently caused to be brought soon
succeeded in first simmering and then boiling.
Dickens’s kettle on the hob never uttered such
delightful music.</p>

<p>If I had been philosophically inclined, and had
possessed a thermometer, which I did not, I might
have availed myself of the opportunity of ascertaining
the exact height we had reached, by seeing
at what number of degrees the fluid boiled. But
what was much more to the purpose, I had some
tea at hand, and two quarts of the hot infusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with a thimblefull of brandy, were soon under my
belt. Never did opium, or bang, or haschish-eater
experience such a sweet feeling stealing over
the sense. Talk of a giant refreshed with wine:
give me tea when I am knocked up. The chemistry-of-common-life
people will talk to you about
Theïne and its nutritious qualities, but until that
moment I did not know what tea would do for
you. My eyes, which just before were half blind,
saw again. My blood, which seemed to be curdled
into thick, heavy lumps, in my veins, was liquified
afresh. That of St. Januarius never underwent
such a quick metamorphosis. Mr. Waterton will
excuse the allusion.</p>

<p>The knoll was at a very high level; the snow
behind us, and the icy runnel issuing from its
bowels at our feet, gave a keenness to the air, but
the tea<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> put me in a genial perspiration, the pea-coat
aiding and abetting by keeping in the caloric.
And when the little horse, refreshed by his nibble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was caught and reloaded, I loaded my fowling-piece,
and felt quite strong enough to carry it.
Before long we were among some grey ptarmigan,
and I brought one or two down.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“Curious spot, this,” said I, to the guide, as
we came to an amphitheatrical ridge of abraded
rock, on the very edge of which rested huge blocks<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
of stone, some pivoted on their smallest face. The
cause of the phenomenon was evident. The glacier
power, which formerly moved these stones
onward, day by day, had been arrested&mdash;<i>opera imperfecta
manebant</i>&mdash;and so the blocks came to a
stand still where they now are. “They must have
been placed there by the Trolls,” I observed, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a peep at Ole’s countenance. “Kanskee” (perhaps),
was his slow and thoughtful reply.</p>

<p>“You ought to see this in winter time,” he continued.
“No stones to be seen then&mdash;no impediments.
We go straight ahead. I travelled
last winter, on snow-shoes, sixty miles in the day.”</p>

<p>Winter is, emphatically, the time for locomotion
here; the crooked ways are made straight, and
the mountains smooth.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said I, pointing to a snail,
browsing on the irregularly round leaf of a species
of dwarf sorrel, which grows high on the mountains.
A “sneel,” said he. “Snecke” is the
modern Norwegian appellation.</p>

<p>Ole is a bit of a sportsman, and has committed
havoc among the reindeer. Last winter he killed
a couple of otters, and got two dollars and a half
for their skins.</p>

<p>“And where did you find the otters?” inquired
I, curious to know whether these animals imitate
the seal and walrus, and make breathing holes in
the solid ice. “Oh, they keep in the foss-pools of
the rivers, which are the only places not frozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
over. Now and then they cut across the land
from one pool to another. I followed them on
snow-shoes, and killed them with a stave. A man
paa ski (on snow-shoes) can overtake an otter.”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” he went on, “we have seen no
‘reen.’ I never came over these mountains without
seeing them.”</p>

<p>But in fact the day had now become overcast, and,
fearful of a relapse, I had abstained from stopping
to examine the surrounding objects more narrowly.
We had now arrived on the left of a lake, about
fourteen miles long, the name of which is Normaends
Laagen. Between us and the lake intervened
a stony plain, grassed over at intervals,
perhaps half a mile in breadth; while close to our
left, some little still valleys ran up towards the
higher plateau.</p>

<p>“There they are,” exclaimed Ole, pointing to
ten reindeer, feeding about two hundred yards off,
between us and the lake. The discovery was
mutual and simultaneous; for, with an oblique
squint at us, their white scuts flew up, and they
trotted leisurely to the southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall I put a bullet into the gun?” asked I.</p>

<p>“No use whatever,” said Ole. “They’ll be
miles off in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, I could see them clearing the
ground at a lazy canter, and presently disappear
behind some rising ground.</p>

<p>Our lodging for the night was to be at a place
called Bessebue. This was a stone hut erected by
some fishermen, who repair hither in the autumn
with a horse or two and some barrels of salt, and
catch the trout which abound in the lake. At that
period, the fish approach the shore from out of the
deeps to spawn, and are taken in a garn, <i>i.e.</i>, standing
net of very fine thread. At other times the hut
is uninhabited. But to my guide’s surprise we find
that there are occupants. These are two brothers
from Urland, on the Sogne Fjord, about sixty miles
from this. They are fine young fellows, named
Nicholas and Andreas Flom, who have come up here
with 110 head of cattle to feed on the shores of the
lake. None but a Norwegian farmer would think
of making such an excursion as this. In September
they will drive them direct across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mountains to Kongsberg for sale. A drove of this
sort, I find, is called drift,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and the drovers driftefolk.</p>

<p>With much good nature these young fellows
offered to share with us all the accommodation that
Bessebue afforded. “But,” said they, “we have
already got three travellers arrived, who are going
to stop the night.”</p>

<p>Now Bessebue, or Bessy’s bower, as I mentally
nicknamed it, albeit there was not a ghost of a
Bessy about the premises, though it might in an
ordinary way lodge a couple of wayfarers did not
seem to offer anything like ample room and verge
enough for “the seven sleepers” who proposed lodging
there that night. Its accommodation consisted
of one room, built of dry stones, with a hole in one
corner of the roof for a chimney, the floor being
divided into two unequal parts by a ledge or slab
of stone, which served for table, and chair, and shelf.
The room might be seven or eight feet square, (not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
so big as the bed of Ware,) part of which, however,
was taken up by certain butter and milk pails and
horse furniture. So, how we were all to sleep I did
not know. Nevertheless, the shivering demon was
again clapperclawing me&mdash;“Poor Tom’s acold.”&mdash;The
good effects of the tea had evaporated, and
aches of all sorts throbbed within my frame. So I
settled down passively on the stone ledge, and
warmed my wet toes against the reeking, sputtering
brands of juniper twig that blazed at intervals,
and served to show, in the advancing night, the
black, slimy, damp-looking sides of the hut.
Above my head was the smoke hole; behind me,
on the floor, were the skins which formed the
drovers’ couch.</p>

<p>After swallowing a fresh jorum of tea, I sank
into this, my pea-coat all around me, and my
sou’-wester, with its flannel lining and ear-covers
tied under my chin; the younger drover, with all
the consideration of a tender nurse, tucking me in
under the clothes. In spite of my superfluity of
clothing, and the smoke with which the apartment
was filled, I had great difficulty in getting warm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
After eating their simple suppers by the light of
the fire, a song was proposed, and one of the
three strangers proceeded to sing, in a clear manly
voice, the national song on Tordenskiold.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The glow of the juniper wood, which had now
burnt down into a heap of red embers, lit up the
features, grave but cheery, of the singer and the
hearers; and all sick as I was, I enjoyed the
whole immensely, after a dreamy fashion, and
longed for the brush of a Schalken to represent
the strange scene. Here we were, on a wild,
trackless, treeless, savage mountain, with creature
comforts none, and yet these simple fellows, without
any effort, were enjoying themselves a vast
deal more than many with all the conventional
appliances and means to secure mirth.</p>

<p>The song of “Gamle Norge,” the “Rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Britannia” of the North, of course succeeded.
After this a song-book was produced from a
crevice under the eaves, and, as the fire was
nearly out, and no more fuel was inside the hut,
a candle-end, which I had brought with me to
grease my boots, being lit, enabled the minstrel
to sing a ditty by inch of candle. It was one
in honour of the Norsk kings, from Harald
Haarfager<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> downwards, by Wergeland, said to
be Norway’s best poet. This closed the entertainment.</p>

<p>“We must get to bed, I think, now,” said
Nicholas; “it is waxing latish, and I must be up
by dawn, after the kreäturen (cattle). I say,
holloa, you Englishman, Metcal; can you make
room for me and Andreas?”</p>

<p>“You can try, but I really don’t see how it is to
be managed, we are such big fellows; I’ll sit on
the ledge, if you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no; you’re ill. It’ll be all right. If we
can only just manage to fit in, it will be square
strax (immediately). You won’t be too warm,”
continued he, pulling a slate over the smoke-hole;
“the night is very cold.”</p>

<p>So, in the brothers got, merely divesting themselves
of their coats and waistcoats, while I had on
all the coats in my wardrobe, like some harlequin
in his first <i>début</i> at a country fair. At first, the
squeeze was very like the operation one has so
often witnessed in the old coaching days, of
wedging any amount of passengers into a seat
made to hold four&mdash;“Higgledy piggledy, here we
lie.” Truly, necessity makes us acquainted with
strange bedfellows. But by degrees we shook
down. When a tea-cup is full to overflowing,
there is room for the sugar. However, it was
necessary, whenever one of us changed his position,
for the others to do the same, like the poor niggers
on board the slaver in the Middle passage. The
coverlets were of the scantiest; but there did
not seem to be any unfair attempt made to steal
a skin from one’s neighbour when he had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to sleep, as the Kansas men are said to be in the
habit of doing when bivouacking out.</p>

<p>The others had, if possible, less elbow-room
than we three. The two elder were allowed to take
the middle places, while the younger ones were
pressed against the damp, hard wall. The hut
was soon quiet; outside it was frosty, with no
wind, and the only noise within was the occasional
snoring of one of the party, which was so sonorous,
that it made me think of “the drone of a Lincolnshire
bagpipe” (see Shakspeare)&mdash;though I can’t
say I ever heard one. At last I fell off. How
soundly I slept that night, with the exception of a
slight touch of nightmare, in which, by an inverted
order of things, I rode the mare instead of the mare
riding me; scudding along at one time after the
reindeer, over stock and stone with wonderful
celerity; at another, dashing in snow-shoes after the
otters, or whirling among the moors, in the midst
of an odd set of elfin coursers and riders.</p>

</div>

<p>The grey light of the morning was peeping through
the hole in the roof, when I was awoke by Nicholas
bestirring himself, and kicking his way through
the conglomerate of prostrate forms. Thank goodness,
my feverish chill had left me. “Richard was
himself again!” The superfluity of vestments,
together with the animal heat generated by seven
human beings, packed as we had been, had done
the business. The black wall I found trickling
with moisture, like the sides of a Russian bath,
from the hot smoke and steam, condensed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
colder stones. I felt no return of the complaint,
and doubtless the sovereign nostrum for me, under
the circumstances, was the one I accidentally took.</p>

<p>After a cup of coffee, some cold trout and biscuit,
I was ready to start; before doing which I
put a trifle in Nicholas’ hand, which he pronounced
a great deal too much. As we trudged along, a
solitary raven or two were not wanting to the
landscape; while, contrasting with their funereal
plumage and dismal croak, was the cheerful twittering
white-rumped stone-chat (steen-ducker),
bobbing about from stone to stone, seemingly
determined to enjoy himself in spite of the Robinson
Crusoe nature of his haunts. Presently I let
fly at a large flock of dotterel&mdash;“Rundfugel,” as
the guide called them&mdash;and made a handsome
addition to the proviant.</p>

<p>In one spot, where the available space for walking
was narrowed by the head of a lake on one
side, and an abrupt hill on the other, we came upon
what looked like a saw-pit, four feet long and two
feet broad, but which had been filled up with large
stones. This, I was informed, was once a pit-fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for the reindeer, but now discontinued. It was
judiciously placed in a defile which the deer were
known to make for when disturbed.</p>

<p>Not far beyond, as I passed what looked like a
grey stone, the guide said&mdash;“That is Viensla Bue.”
In fact, it was a small den, four feet high, constructed
by some reindeer-hunter. I peeped in, and
saw an iron pot and bed of moss, which show that
it is still at times visited by man.</p>

<p>“Yonder is Harteigen,” exclaimed Ole, pointing
to a singular square-shaped mountain, to the left,
with precipitous sides, which looked two or three
miles off, but which was in reality a dozen; such
is the clearness of this atmosphere. Indeed, at
home, every object appears to me to have a fuzzy,
indistinct outline, when compared with the intensely
sharp, definite outline of everything here.</p>

<p>“That mountain to our right, is Granatknuten,”
continued my guide, “and this is Soveringsrindan.”</p>

<p>At least such was the name, as far as I could
decipher his strange pronunciation, of the curious
terraced elevation on which our path now lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>It looked like a regular embankment, which it
was difficult to imagine was not the work of men’s
hands. In height, this terrace varied from thirty
to eighty feet; its crown, which was perfectly even,
and composed of shingle, mossed over in places,
was about twenty feet broad, and afforded excellent
walking; while in length it was about two English
miles, and formed a gentle curve, cut in two about
midway by a stream flowing from the Granatknuten
to our right. On either side of the terrace
were narrow moat-like lakes; while, to complete
the illusion of its being a work of defence, at the
distance of a few hundred yards to the right below
the mountain, stood a mass of what seemed the
irregular fortifications of an old castle.</p>

<p>Leaving the terrace, we presently walked along
the bed of an ancient torrent, the peculiarity of
which was that the stones which formed it fitted so
exactly that they looked as if they had been laid by
the hand of a mason. Before long we joined company
with a stream going the same way as ourselves,
so that we have now passed the water-shed.
Hitherto the waters we have seen find their outlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in the River Lougen, which flows down past Kongsberg
to Laurvig, at the mouth of the Christiania-Fjord.
Henceforward all the converging streams
descend into the Hardanger-Fjord.</p>

<p>After a rough descent, we reach the first sæter,
where Ole stops to talk with a damsel, Gunvor by
name. Her dark hair, being drawn tightly back,
so as to leave a thorough view of her well-cut face,
eventuated in two tails, neatly braided with red
tape.</p>

<p>A sleeveless jacket of red cloth fitted tightly to
her figure, reminding me of the Tyrolese bodice,
while her arms were covered with voluminous
coarse linen shirt-sleeves, of spotless white, and
buttoned at the wrist, while the collar was fastened
at the throat to large silver studs. Across her
bosom, in the fork of the bodice, was an inner
patch of black cloth, garnished with beads.
Gunvor smiled with an air of conscious pride as
she bid us enter into her sæter, which, like herself,
was extremely neat, contrasting favourably with
the slovenly appearance of things in Thelemarken,
which I had left behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Around were ranged well-scoured vessels, full of
all the mysterious products of the mountain dairy;
were I to recount the names of which, the reader,
who knows practically of nothing beyond milk and
cream, and cheese and butter, would be astonished
that so many things, of which he never heard, could
be prepared out of simple cow’s and goat’s milk.
The only thing that did not quite square with my
notions of the idyllic modesty and simplicity of the
scene was the sight of a youth, who had come up
from the Hardanger, and was a servant of the
farmer to whom the sæter belonged, stretched out
asleep on Gunvor’s bed.</p>

<p>Refreshed with a lump of reindeer flesh out of
my wallet, together with thick milk and brandy, we
followed the path in its circuit round some more
<i>rochers montonnées</i>, where the action of former
glaciers is visible to perfection in the smoothed inclines
and erratic blocks now standing stockstill.
After many a toilsome up and down, we at length
get the first bird’s-eye view of a darksome piece of
water, lying thousands of feet below us in a deep
trough of gigantic precipices. My destination is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the farm-house of Garatun (tun = town, the original
meaning of which was enclosure); but to my
utter astonishment I find that we have still fourteen
miles of toil between us and the haven of rest.</p>

<p>Before long we overtake a singular cavalcade,
which afforded an insight into Norwegian peasant
life. There were four light little horses, each
loaded with what looked like a pair of enormous
milk pails. These are called strumpe, and are full of
whey or thick milk, or some product of the mountain
dairy. Two men followed the horses, each with a
sort of Alpen-stock, only that at the end, grasped
by the hand, there stuck out a stump of a branch.
This I found is not only used as a walking staff, but
is also most useful in another way. Each of the
pails has of course to be hung on the straddle separately,
and unless there is a second man to hold
up the pail, already slung, till the other is also
adjusted, the straddle would turn round under the
horse’s belly, and the pail upset. This crutched
stick, therefore, is used to prop up one side until
the counterpoising pail is suspended on the other side
the horse. Besides the men, there was a young girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with her fair hair braided with red tape, her bodice
of green cloth, while the stomacher or “bringeklut”
was of red cloth, studded as usual with strings
of coloured beads. A little boy was also of the
party, dressed in the costume of the men, the only
characteristic feature of which was a pair of red
garters, tied <i>over</i> the trousers below the knee, for
the purpose I heard of keeping them out of the
dirt.</p>

<p>The descent into Tjelmö-dal was terrific. My
horse was lightly loaded; but the others were
weighted, as I thought, beyond their powers, and
the liquid within was alive, and swayed about, and
was therefore more burdensome than dead weight
proper. But, as usual, the horses were left to
pick their own way, which was in places steeper
than the ascent of St. Paul’s, the only assistance
given them being a drag on the crupper from
behind. The crupper, be it said, was not such as
one generally sees, but a pole, about two feet long,
curved in the middle for the tail to fit into, with
either end fastened by wicker straps to the corresponding
pail. This pristine contrivance, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
has no doubt been in use for centuries, keeps the
weight comparatively steady, and eases the horse.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Where do you come from?
Are you an Englishman? Are you a landscape
painter?” was a part of the volley of questions
which they forthwith discharged at the writer of
these lines, as he joined the party at the side of
a thundering torrent of some breadth and depth&mdash;too
deep to ford&mdash;where the little boy and girl, I
observed, were jumping upon the nags.</p>

<p>“May I mount on that horse?” was the short
interrogatory with which I answered them, having
an eye to the main chance, and thinking that my
tired horse, who was moreover far behind, had
little chance of getting safely over with me on his
back.</p>

<p>“Be so good! be so good! (vær so godt!)”
was the good-natured reply, and I was in a moment
astride of the animal, after the fashion for riding
donkeys bareback in England, <i>i.e.</i>, more aft than
forward; and, after a few plunges among the stones,
we were safe over the cataract. The two men, by
the aid of their poles, crossed just above, leaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
from one slippery stone to another, at the risk of
flopping into the deep gurgling rapids that rushed
between them.</p>

<p>We had scarcely got through when a terrible
commotion was raised in front, and a simultaneous
burst of “burra burraing” (wohoa-ing) ensued from
all the party. In turning an angle of the corkscrew
descent one of the pails had caught a projecting
rock, and become unhooked, and was rolling away,
the horse very nearly doing the same thing, right
over the precipice. To stop its course, lift it up,
and hook it on the straddle, was a task speedily
accomplished by these agile mountaineers.</p>

<p>The fright having subsided, off we started again,
and the queries recommenced. A Norwegian is a
stubborn fellow, and sticks to his point. Little
was to be got out of me but parrying answers, and
the peasants guessed me of all the countries of
Europe, ultimately fixing on Denmark as my probable
native country.</p>

<p>After twisting and turning and passing one or
two waterfalls of considerable height, we at
length reached the bottom of the chasm, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the river, which I had left some hours before,
had forced its almost subterranean passage from
the Fjeld. The gigantic wall of limestone on
the opposite side rose, I should say at a rough
guess, five times as high as the cliff impending
over the Giant’s Causeway, and in more than one
spot a force tumbled over the battlements.</p>

<p>By nine o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, to my great relief, as I
was miserably foot-sore, my boots not having been
properly greased, we arrived at Garatun, one of
half a dozen small farmsteads that lay on the small
grassy slopes by the side of the dark Eidsfjord.
An old crone showed me upstairs into a room,
round which were ranged eight chests or boxes
with arching tops, painted in gaudy colours, with
the name of Niels Garatun and his wife inscribed
thereon. Round the wooden walls I counted
twenty cloth dresses of red, green, and blue, suspended
from wooden pegs. No beer being procurable,
I slaked my raging thirst, while coffee
was preparing, with copious draughts of prim, a
sort of whey.</p>

<p>Before long, two or three peasants stalked in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hands in pockets, and forthwith, according to
custom, commenced squirting tobacco-juice from
their mouths with all the assiduity of Yankees.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Are you going up to the Foss
to-morrow? Will you have a horse and a man?
Many gentlemen give one dollar for the horse and
one for the man. It’s meget brat (very steep);
Slem Vei (bad road).”</p>

<p>To all which observations I replied that I was
very tired, and could answer no questions at all
that night. Upon which the spitters retired with
an air of misgiving about me, as they had evidently
calculated on nailing the foreigner to a bargain at
the first blush of the thing; and, when the news
of my arrival got wind, their market was sure to
be lowered by competition. One of them, after
closing the door, popped his head in again, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“He thought he could do it cheaper; but I had
better say at once, else he should be up to the
sæter in the morning before I got up.”</p>

<p>“I would say nothing till nine o’clock the next
morning,” was my reply, and I was left to rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
undisturbed; the men apparently thinking me an
odd individual.</p>

<p>Long before nine o’clock my slumbers were
disturbed by the entrance of a sharp-looking individual,
who asked if I would have coffee? He
did not belong to the house even; but by this <i>ruse</i>
it was evident he intended to steal a march on the
others.</p>

<p>“For four orts” (three shillings and fourpence),
said he, “I’ll guide you up to the Foss, and then
row you across the lake to Vik on the Hardanger.”
The bargain was concluded at once; not a little to
the consternation of the two dollar men, who, when
they presented themselves at 9 o’clock, found that
they were forestalled.</p>

</div>

<p>From my guide I learn that this land’s-end nook
has been lately in a tremendous ferment, in consequence
of the young Prince of Orange, who is
making a tour in company with the Crown Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of Norway, having visited the Vöring Foss. The
Prince, whom report destines for England’s second
Princess, appears to have been very plucky (meget
flink) at the outset of the excursion, and outwalked
all the rest of the party&mdash;at all events they
suffered him to think so. Half way up, however, he
was dead beat, and compelled to get on pony back.</p>

<p>At first the narrow valley is tolerably level,
blocked up, however, with monstrous rocks and
stones. Soon we arrive at a crazy bridge spanning
the torrent. Striding on to this, Herjus turns round
to see what I am doing. Finding me close behind,
he goes on. The traveller in Norway must
learn at a pinch</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">To cross a torrent foaming loud</div>
<div class="verse">On the uncertain footing of a spear.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Many people get frightened at this bridge,”
says he, “and we are forced to lead them over.”</p>

<p>At this I was not surprised. Three fir trees, of
immense length, thrown across the thundering
waters from two projecting cliffs, and supported
midway by a rock in the stream, formed the permanent
way. This, I understood, was very rotten;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
there was no sort of hand-railing, and at every step
we took the frail timbers swayed unpleasantly with
our weight. Passing Möbu, up to which salmon
force their way, we recross the stream by a newly
constructed, safe bridge, and leave it to thread its
passage through cliffs, where no man can follow, to
the foot of the mighty Vöring Foss.</p>

<p>We now begin to ascend a precipitous path right
in front of us, which here and there assumes the
shape of a regular staircase, by means of rough
slabs of rock, placed one above another. If I had
encountered a laden horse coming down the steps
of the Monument, I should not have been more
astonished than I was, on meeting upon this staircase
a horse, loaded with two great pails. Close
behind him was one Knut Tveitö. Grasping
tightly at the wooden crupper described in the last
chapter (hale-stock = tail-stick), he acted as a powerful
drag to break the animal’s descent. With reins
hanging loosely on his extended neck, ears pricked
up, and fore-foot put forward as a feeler into
mid-air, the sagacious little beast, with nothing
more than his own good sense to guide him, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
groping his way down the loose and steep steps,
now and then giving a sort of expostulatory grunt,
as the great iron nails in his shoes slip along a
rock, or he receives a jolt more shaking than
ordinary.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“Wilkommen fra Stölen” (welcome from the
châlet), was the expressive greeting of Herjus to
the stranger, whose reply was, “Gesegned arbeid!”
(blessed labour). My guide’s words first awoke me
to the fact that this is the path by which Knut
had to toil to the summer pasture of his flocks
and herds.</p>

<p>Bidding farewell to Knut, who waited a few
minutes while I made a rough sketch of himself
and his horse, we went on climbing. Hitherto the
height of the mountains around had served to keep
out the sun’s rays; but now our altitude was such,
that they no longer served as a parasol, and as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
emerged from the shadow into the broiling glare,
the labour became proportionately greater. But
we soon reach the top of the ascent, and open upon
a bleak moor, flagged at intervals with flattish
stones.</p>

<p>To the north rose a roundish mountain, clad with
snow. This is Iökeln, 5700 feet high, called by
the natives Yuklin. Between us and it, at the
distance of about a mile across the moor, rose a
thin, perpendicular spire of smoke, which might
have been taken for the reek of a gipsy campfire.</p>

<p>“That’s Vöring,” said the guide, stuffing a
quantity of blue and cloud berries into his mouth.
“We shall have good weather; you should see
Vöring when the weather is going to be bad&mdash;doesn’t
he smoke then?”</p>

<p>I observed that all the people here talked thus
of the Fall, assigning a sort of personality to the
monster, as if it was something more than a mere
body of water.</p>

<p>“And here we are at Vöring,” said the guide,
after we had steeple-chased straight across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
swamp to the shadowy spire. As he said this, he
pointed down into an abyss, from which proceeded
dull-sounding thunderings.</p>

<p>I found we were standing on the verge of a portentous
crater, nine hundred feet deep, into which
springs, at one desperate bound, the frantic water-spirit.
The guide’s phlegmatic appearance at this
moment was a striking contrast to the excitement
of Paddy this summer, when he was showing me
the organ-pipes of the Giant’s Causeway, sounding
with the winds of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“This, yer honner, is allowed by all thravellers
to be the most wonderfullest scane in the whole
world. There’s nothing to be found like it at all
at all. Many professors have told me so.”</p>

<p>Straight opposite to us the cliff rose two or
three hundred feet higher, and shot down another
stream of no mean volume. But it was the contact
of the Vöring with the black pit-bottom
that I desired to see. This, however, is no easy
matter. At length I fixed on what appeared to
be the best spot, and requesting the man to gripe
my hand tight, I craned over as far as I could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and got a view of the whole monster at once. Did
not he writhe, and dart, and foam, and roar like
some hideous projectile blazing across the dark
sky at night. Such a sight I shall never behold
again. It was truly terrific. It was well that the
guide held me fast, for a strange feeling, such as
Byron describes, as if of wishing to jump overboard,
came over me in spite of myself.</p>

<p>But, after all, the Vöring Foss is a disappointment.
You can’t see it properly. A capital defect.
One adventurous Englishman, I understand, did
manage by making a detour, to descend the cliff,
and actually launched an India-rubber boat&mdash;what
odd fellows Englishmen are&mdash;on the infernal surge
below. A man who was with him told me he held
the boat tight by a rope, while the Briton paddled
over the pool. Arrived there, without looking at
the stupendous column which rose from where he
was to the clouds, or rather did <i>vice versá</i>, he pulled
out of his pocket a small pot of white paint, and
forthwith commenced painting his initials on
the rock, to prove, as he said, that he had been
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>This reminds me of one of our countrymen who
arrived in his carriage at dead of night at some
Italian city of great interest. “Antonio, what is
the name of this place?” On hearing it, he puts
the name down in his pocket-book, and orders the
horses, exclaiming&mdash;“Thank goodness; done another
place.”</p>

<p>The next thing will be that we shall hear of
some Beckford blasting the rock, and erecting a
summer-house like that at the Falls of the Rhine,
for the tourists to peep out of.</p>

<p>Fancy a Dutchman in such a place! The elation
of the Prince of Orange, when he got to this
spot, was such, that he and the botanist who accompanied
him, are recorded to have drunk more wine
than was good for them. “Pull off your hat, sir,”
he hiccuped to the chief guide, in reverence, the
reader will suppose, to the spirit of the spot.
“Pull off your hat, I say; it is not every day that
you guide a Prince to the Vöring!”</p>

<p>It was not till six o’clock that we were down
at Garatun; so that the excursion is a good
stiff day’s work. But to this sort of thing I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
had become accustomed, having walked on the
two preceding days a distance of more than sixty
English miles.</p>

<p>Crossing the gloomy little lake Eidsfjord, in a
small boat rowed by my guide, and then over the
little isthmus which separates it from the sea, I arrived
at the “Merchant’s” at Vik. An English yacht,
with Oxford men on board, lay at anchor close by.
This I boarded forthwith, and was entertained
by the hospitable owner with tea and news from
England.</p>

<p>Magnus, the innkeeper, is evidently a man
making haste to be rich. He has cows in plenty on
the mountains; but he takes care to keep them there,
and there is, consequently, not a vestige of cream or
milk in his establishment, let alone meat, or anything
but flad-brod and salted trout. He exultingly
tells me that he was the guide-in-chief to the Dutch
Prince, and what a lot of dollars he got for it. I
don’t know whether these people belie his Royal
Highness, but here is another anecdote at his
expense.</p>

<p>“Magnus,” said the Prince, after paying him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
“are you content? Have I paid as much as any
Englishman ever did? For if any Englishman
ever paid more, tell me, and I’ll not be beaten.”</p>

<p>As far as I could gather, Magnus, in reply,
hummed and hawed in a somewhat dubious manner,
and thus managed to extract a dollar or two
more from his Highness.</p>

<p>Princes, by-the-bye, seem the order of the day.
During the few hours I stopped here, a Prussian
Prince and his suite, travelling <i>incognito</i>, also
arrived, and passed on to the Waterfall.</p>

<p>The stream between this and the fresh-water lake
above holds salmon and grilse, but there are no
good pools.</p>

<p>On a lovely morning I took boat for Utne,
further out in the Hardanger-Fjord. The English
yacht had left some hours before, but was lying
becalmed, the white sail hanging against the mast,
under some tall cliffs flanking the entrance to the
small Ulvik-Fjord. One or two stray clouds,
moving lazily overhead, throw a dark shadow on
the mountains, which are bathed in warm sunshine.
Among the dark-green foliage and grey rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
which skirt the rocky sides of the Fjord for miles
in front of us, may at times be descried a bright
yellow patch, denoting a few square yards of ripening
corn, which some peasant has contrived to conjure
out of the wilderness. Near the little patch
may be descried a speck betokening the cabin of
the said Selkirk.</p>

<p>As you approach nearer, you descry, concealed
in a little nook cut out by nature in the solid rock,
the skiff in which the lonely wight escapes at times
from his isolation. In fact, he ekes out his subsistence
by catching herring or mackerel, or any of the
numerous finny tribes which frequent these fjords;
in some measure making up to the settlers the
barrenness of the soil. Presently I hear a distant
sound in the tree-tops. Look! the clouds, hitherto
so lazy, are on the move; the placid water, which
reflected the yacht and its sails so distinctly just
now, becomes ruffled and darkens; and anon a
strong wind springs forth from its craggy hiding-place.
See! it has already reached the craft, and
she is dancing out into the offing, lying down to
the water in a manner that shows she will soon
lessen her eight miles distance from us, and beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
out to sea with very little difficulty. As for poor
luckless me, the boatmen had, of course, forgotten
to take a sail; so that the wind, which is partly
contrary, and soon gets up a good deal of sea,
greatly retards our progress.</p>

<p>At length we arrive at Utne, a charming spot
lying at the north-western entrance to the Sör-Fjord.
What excellent quarters I found here.
The mistress, the wife of the merchant, a most
tidy-looking lady, wearing the odd-looking cap of
the country, crimped and starched with great care,
bustled about to make me comfortable. Wine
and beer, pancakes and cherries, fresh lamb
and whiting&mdash;O noctes cœnæque Deum!&mdash;such
were the delicacies that fell to my share, and which
were, of course, all the more appreciated by me
after a fortnight’s semi-starvation among the
mountains, crowned by the stingy fare of the
dollar-loving Magnus.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>I think I have not mentioned that in Thelemarken
and the Hardanger district one meets
with quite a different class of Christian names
from elsewhere in Norway, where the common-place
Danish names, often taken from Scripture,
are usual. Ole, it is true, being the name of
the great national saint, is rife all over, especially
in Hallingdal; so much so that if you meet
with three men from that district, you are sure,
they say, to find one of the three rejoicing in
that appellation. The female part of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
here rejoice in the names of Torbior, Guro, and
Ingiliv.</p>

<p>“I wish, Guro, you would teach me the names
of the various articles of female attire you wear,”
said I to the said damsel, a rosy-cheeked lass, her
mouth and eyes, like most of the girls in the
country, brimfull of good nature, though, perhaps,
not smacking of much refinement. Her hair-tails
were, as usual, braided with red tape: and, it
being Sunday, these were bound round her head
in the most approved modern French fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh! that is called Troie,” said she, as I
pointed to a close-fitting jacket of blue cloth,
which, the weather being chilly, she wore over
all; and this is called Overliv&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the vest of
green fitting tight to her shape, with the waist in
the right place.</p>

<p>What can so good a judge as Sir Bulwer Lytton,
by-the-bye, be about when he talks somewhere of a
“short waist not being unbecoming, as giving
greater sweep to a majestic length of limb.”</p>

<p>“And this is the Bringe-klud” (the little bit of
cloth placed across the middle of the bosom);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
“and this is called Stak,” continued she, with a
whole giggle, and half a blush.</p>

<p>“And who was that reading aloud below this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was Torbior” (the mistress of the
house).</p>

<p>“And what was she reading?”</p>

<p>“The Bible; she always does that every morning.
We all assemble together in that room.”</p>

<p>Guro was fair; not so many of the inhabitants
of the Hardanger district. The dark physiognomies
and black eyes of some of the peasants
contrast as forcibly with the blond aspect of the
mass, as the Spanish faces in Galway do with the
fair complexions of the generality of the daughters
of Erin. One wonders how they got them. I
never heard any satisfactory solution offered of the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>Two Englishmen, who have also found their
way hither, are gone to have a sight of the
neighbouring Folge Fond. One of them is a
Winchester lad, who has been working himself
nearly blind and quite ill. His companion is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a literary turn, and indulges in fits of abstraction.
Emerging from one of these, he asks me whether
there is ever a full moon in Carnival-time at
Rome. Eventually, I discover the reason of his
query. He is writing a novel, and his “Pyramus
and Thisbe” meet within the Colosseum walls, at
that period of rejoicing, by moonlight. But more
circumspect than Wilkie, who makes one of the
figures in his Waterloo picture eating oysters in
June, he is guarding against the possibility of an
anachronism.</p>

<p>Among the luxuries of this most tidy establishment
are some Christiania papers. The prominent
news is the progress of the Crown Prince, who is
travelling in these parts. He landed here, and
sketched the magnificent mountains that form the
portals of the enchanting Sör (South) Fjord. At
Ullenswang, on the west shore of that Fjord, he
invited all the good ladies and gentlemen, from far
and near, to a ball on board his yacht <i>Vidar</i>, dancing
with the prettiest of them. What particularly
pleases the natives is the Prince’s free and easy
way of going on. He chews tobacco strenuously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and to one public functionary he offered a quid
(skrue), with the observation, “Er de en saadaan
karl (Is this in your line)?” At a station in
Romsdal, where he slept, he was up long before
the aides-de-camp. After smoking a cigar with the
Lehnsman in the keen morning air, finding that his
attendants were still asleep, he went to their
apartment, and, like an Eton lad, pulled all the
clothes from their beds.</p>

<p>The great advantage which will ensue from the
personal acquaintance thus formed between the
Prince and this sturdy section of his subjects, is
thoroughly understood, and the Norskmen appreciate
the good of it, after their own independent
fashion. One or two speakers, however, have greeted
him with rather inflated and fulsome speeches, going
so far as to liken him to St. Olaf, of pious memory.
The only resemblance appears to be, that he is
the first royal personage, since the days of that
monarch, who has visited these mountains.</p>

<p>Utne has some curious historical recollections.
In a hillock near the house several klinkers, such
as those used for fastening the planking of vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
have been discovered. Here then is a confirmation
of the accounts given by Snorr. The ship,
which was the Viking’s most valuable possession,
which had borne him to foreign lands, to booty
and to fame, was, at his death, drawn upon land;
his body was then placed in it, and both were
consumed by fire. Earth was then heaped over
the ashes, and the grave encircled by a ship-shaped
enclosure of upright stones, a taller stone
being placed in the centre to represent the mast.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, the dying Sea King’s obsequies
were celebrated in a fashion, around which the
halo of romance has been thrown. “King Hake
of Sweden cuts and slashes in battle as long as he
can stand, then orders his war-ship, loaded with
his dead men and their weapons, to be taken out
to sea, the tiller shipped, and the sails spread;
being left alone, he sets fire to some tar-wood, and
lies down contented on the deck. The wind blew
off the land, the ship flew, burning in clear flame,
out between the islets and into the ocean, and
there was the right end of King Hake.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Considering that this place is so near such an
enormous tract of snow and ice as the Folgefond,
it is rather astonishing to find that it will grow
cherries, apples, and corn, better than most places
around.</p>

<p>I make a point in all these spots of examining
any printed notice that I may come across, as
being likely to throw light on the country and its
institutions. Here, for instance, is a Government
ordinance of 1855, about the Fante-folk, otherwise
Tatere, or gipsies. From this I learn that some
fifteen hundred of these Bedouins are moving
about the kingdom, with children, who, like themselves,
have never had Christian baptism or Christian
instruction. They are herewith invited to
settle down, and the Government promises to
afford them help for this purpose; otherwise they
shall still be called “gipsies,” and persecuted in
various ways.</p>

</div>

<p>From Utne I take boat for a spot called Ose, in
a secluded arm of the Fjord. My boatman, an
intelligent fellow, tells me that Asbjörnsen, the
author of a book of Fairy Tales, is now, like Mr.
Kingsley, turned naturalist, and has been dredging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with a skrabe (scraper) about here. He has
discovered one small mussel, and a new kind of
star-fish, with twelve rays about twelve inches
long, body about the size of a crown-piece, and
the whole of a bright red. The rays are remarkably
brittle. This I afterwards saw in the Museum
at Bergen. Asbjörnsen is an exceedingly
stout man, and very fat, and the simple country-people
have the idea, therefore, that he must be
very rich. Wealth and fatness they believe must
go together.</p>

<p>The wind, which had all the morning been
blowing from the land, as the afternoon advances
veers round, like the Bise of the Mediterranean,
and thus becomes in our favour. I now see the
reason why the men would not start till the afternoon.
In fine weather, the wind almost invariably
blows from the sea after mid-day, and from
the mountain in the morning; and, in illustration
of the law that action and reaction are always
equal and contrary, the stronger it blows out, the
stronger it blows in. Tit for tat.</p>

<p>Erik, who is very communicative, says, “This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is our election day at Bergen for South Bergen-Stift.
We don’t choose directly; every hundred
men elect one; and this College of Voters elects
the Storthing’s-man. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, the clergyman,
is one of the sitting members.”</p>

<p>“Has every male adult a vote?”</p>

<p>“No. In the country they must have a land-qualification,
and pay so much tax to Government;
besides which, before they can exercise
their franchise, they must swear to the Constitution.
People think much more of the privilege
than they did formerly. Several have qualified
lately. The more voters, the more Storthing’s-men,
so that the Storthing is increasing in number.”</p>

<p>As we scud along, we pass a stage projecting
from a rock. This is a Laxstie, or place where
salmon are caught, as they swim by, by means of
a capstan-net, which is hoisted up suddenly as
they pass over it. But I shall have occasion to
describe one of these curious contrivances hereafter.</p>

<p>“Very curious fish, those salmon,” continued
my informant. “They are very fond of light&mdash;like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
moths for that; always like to take up the
Fjord where the cliffs are lowest&mdash;at least, so I hear.”</p>

<p>The breeze being fresh, we went gaily along;
“So hurtig som sex” (as quick as six), said the
man, using a saying of the country. Presently,
he fastened the sheet, drew a lump of tobacco out
of his waistcoat-pocket, and began to chew.</p>

<p>“You must not fasten the sheet,” interposed I.</p>

<p>“Why, you are not ‘sö-raed’ (frightened of the
sea)?”</p>

<p>“No; but you Norskmen are very careless.
Supposing a Kaste-wind comes from that mountain
plump upon us, where are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is never the case in summer.”</p>

<p>“Can you swim?” said I.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can; so that in case of accident you
have more reason to be alarmed than I. But I have
property in the boat, and I shan’t run the risk of
losing it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you English are very particular. Not
long ago I rowed four Englishmen. Directly we
got in the bay, although it was beautiful weather,
one and all they pulled out a cloth bag with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a screw to it, and blew it up, and put it round
their waists.”</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at my countrymen’s
peculiarities. As we swept along under the cliffs,
I inquired whether there were any bears about here.</p>

<p>“Bears! forstaae sig (to be sure)! You see
that speck yonder? That’s Vellavik.”</p>

<p>I took out my double glass to discern it&mdash;they
are infinitely superior to the single ones.</p>

<p>“Bless me! why you have got a skue-spil
kikkert<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> (theatre-glass)!”</p>

<p>“Skue-spil! what do you know about skue-spil?”</p>

<p>“Why, I once was at Bergen, and went to see a
play.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! And how did you like it?”</p>

<p>“Not much. I also saw a juggler and a rope-dancer:
that I liked a vast deal better.”</p>

<p>“But about that bear at Vellavik?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Well, Paulsen Vellavik, who lives
yonder, was up under the mountain early in the
spring. The bears get up there then to eat the
young grass, for it springs there first. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
coming down a narrow scaur&mdash;you know what I
mean? Such a place as that yonder”&mdash;pointing
to a deep scaur in the side of the mountain.
“Suddenly he meets four bears coming towards
him, two old, two young. The bears did not wish
to meet him, for when they were some distance
off, they turned out of the road, and tried to climb
up out of the scaur; but it was too steep. So
down they came towards him, growling horribly.
He immediately stuffed his body, head foremost,
into a hole which he saw in the cliff. It was not
deep enough to get himself hidden in. His legs
stuck out. In another second two of the bears
were upon him, biting at his legs. To scream was
death. His only chance of preservation was to sham
dead. After biting him, and putting him to great
pain, which he endured without a sound, the bears
paused, and listened attentively. Paulsen could
distinctly feel their hot breath, and, indeed, see
them from his hiding-place. After thus listening
some time, and not hearing him breathe or move,
they came to the conclusion that he was dead, and
then they left him. Faint with loss of blood, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
legs frightfully bitten, he managed, nevertheless,
to crawl home, and is slowly recovering.”</p>

<p>“That is a very good bear-story,” said I; “have
you another?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, the bear is a curious creature; he
does not become so savage all at once. When
they are young, they eat berries and grass; presently
they take to killing small cattle&mdash;I mean
sheep and goats. Later in life they begin killing
horses and cows, and when the bear is very old,
he attacks men. But they are great cowards
sometimes. Ivar Aslaacson met a she-bear and
three young ones this summer. She bit his leg;
but he drove her off with nothing but a bidsel”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
iron bit and bridle.</p>

<p>The biter bit, as you may say. This seems
rather a favourite weapon of attack. Snorro relates
how those two ruffians, Arek and Erek, rode off
together into the forest, and were found dead,
their heads punched in “med hesten-hoved-band”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
with their horses’ bits.</p>

<p>“Once,” continued my informant, “I and a
party of young fellows went up to a sæter on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
mainland, just opposite Utne. It was Sunday,
and we were going to have a lark with the sæter
girls. They were in great alarm, for they had
seen a bear snuffing about. Off we set in pursuit.
At last we found him, skulking about, and drove
him with our cries down towards the cliffs that
look over the Fjord. We saw him just below us,
and shouted with all our might, and the dogs
barked. This alarmed him, and he seemed to lose
his head, for he jumped to a place where there was
no getting away from. Down we thundered rocks
and stones at him. He looked in doubt what to
do. Then he tried to jump upon another rock;
but the stone slipped from under him, and rolled
down, and he after it, and broke his neck. A
famous fat fellow he was.</p>

<p>“A year or two ago, some men were fishing
along shore at Skudenaes, when, lo and behold,
they saw something white swimming along straight
for the land. It was a white bear. One of them
landed, and ran for a gun, and shot at the beast as
it touched the shore. It put up its paws in a
supplicating manner, as if to beg them to be merciful,
but a shot or two more killed the animal without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it offering any resistance. It is thought that
the creature had escaped from some ship coming
from Spitzbergen.”</p>

<p>After a favourable run, we enter a deep Fjord,
and landing at its extremity, march up to a
cluster of houses. Here I agree with one Simon,
for the sum of three dollars, to convey my effects
over the Fjeld to the Sogne Fjord. His daughter
Sunniva prepares me some coffee. To ladle out
the cream, she places on the board a stumpy silver
spoon, the gilding of which is nearly worn off.
It was shaped like an Apostle spoon, except that
the shaft was very short, and ended in something
like the capital of a pillar.</p>

<p>“That’s a curious spoon,” I observed to Madam,
who now appeared on household cares intent.</p>

<p>“Ah! that belonged to my grandfather, Christopher
Gaeldnaes. Did you never hear of him?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I ever did.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Why he was a man renowned for
wisdom and wealth all over Norway in the Danish
days. Our clergyman tells me that this sort of
spoon used to be hung round the child’s neck
at baptism.” (Döbe = dipping.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Museum of Northern Antiquities at
Copenhagen, a similar one may be seen.</p>

<p>The extent of the household accommodations
was not great. There were no sheets; as a make-shift,
I suggested a table-cloth, of the existence
of which I was aware; and, in place of a towel,
the <i>pis-aller</i> was a shirt. I rose at three
o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, as we had a long journey before us;
but Simon was not ready till much later. He was
evidently a fumbling sort of fellow; and even
when we had started, he had to run back and get
something he had forgotten. From my experience
in guides, I augured ill of his capabilities. To
judge from the map, I thought we ought to
accomplish the passage of the Fjeld before dark;
but all that could be got out of him on this subject
was, he could not say. If we couldn’t get over,
there was a châlet where we might sleep.</p>

<p>As we trudged up the very narrow valley behind
the houses, following the brawling stream, I had
leisure to survey the surrounding objects. Right
and left were impending mountains of enormous
height, while in front of us stood, forbidding our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
approach, a wall of rock. Behind lay the placid
Fjord, with a view of Folgefond in the distance,
just catching the blush of the sunrise. The
summits of some of the cliffs were cut into all
sorts of fantastic shapes. The stupendous ruins
which choked the path and stream, and were of
limestone, at once explained the reason of the
horrid forms above. The rock, from its nature, is
evidently given to breaking away, and when it
does so, does not study appearances. My guide,
however, has something to say on the subject.</p>

<p>“Yonder, sir, is the priest. Don’t you see him?
His nose (Probst-snabel) came away some months
ago, so that now his face is not so easy to make
out. That other rock goes by the name of Störk’s
stool. Did you ever hear the story? Störk was
a strong man, and a daring withal. One day he
was up at a Thing (assize) at Kinservik, where the
Bishop presided. Enraged at some decision made
by his right reverence, Störk struck at him with
his axe, but luckily missed him, making a fearful
gash in the door-post. Störk immediately fled to
Ose, below there. Not long after, the Bishop’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
boat was descried rowing into the Fjord, to take
vengeance for the act of violence. Störk at once
fled up to that rock there, to watch the proceedings.
Close by it there is a hole, and he had
ready a vast flat stone, for the purpose of drawing
it over the mouth, in case the Bishop came in
pursuit. Meantime, he had left instructions with
his son Tholf (which also means twelve) how to
act. Tholf, who was a huge fellow, and nearly as
strong as his father, set out in his boat to meet
the Bishop, having on board a barrel of beer. As
the other boat drew near he rested on his oars,
and asked the Bishop’s permission to drink his
health; and this being given, he took up the
barrel and began drinking out of the bung-hole.
The size of this fellow rather appalled the Bishop,
who discreetly inquired whether Störk had any
other such sons. ‘He has <i>Tholf</i>,’ was the crafty
answer. When the Bishop, not relishing an
encounter with twelve such fellows, turned his
boat round, and retreated with all speed.”</p>

<p>In spite of my anticipations, I find the path
gradually unfolds itself as we advance, worming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in and out of the rocks. More luxuriant shrub-vegetation
I never beheld; a perfect Paradise of
Sub-alpine plants. There were raspberries, and
strawberries, and haeggebaer (bird-cherry), the
wood of which is the toughest in Norway; besides
many kinds of wild flowers, peeping among the
fallen rocks. And then the ferns: there was the
delicate oak-leaved fern, and the magnificent
“polysticum logkitis,” with several others. Growing
among these was a plant which appeared to be
parsley-fern, specimens of which I stuffed into my
book.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s a nasty plant, sir,” said my guide.
“En hel Maengde (a great lot) of it grows hereabouts.
We call it Torboll” (I suppose from the
destroying god Thor), “or Heste-spraeng (horse-burster).
It stops them up at once, and they begin
to swell, and the only chance then is a clyster.”</p>

<p>The cause of all this luxuriance of vegetation is
to be found in the sheltered position of the valley,
and the moisture caused by the</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>One wonders where so much water comes from;
till, lifting up the eye beyond the tall cliffs that
lie still in the shadow, the vision lights on a field
of glistening snow, which the morning sun has
just caught and illumined.</p>

<p>Each step that we ascend the flowers grow perceptibly
smaller and smaller, but their tints
brighter, while the scenery grows more rugged
and sombre, and its proportions vaster&mdash;an apt
representation of savage strength pillowing beauty
on its bosom.</p>

<p>As we climb higher and higher, we pass a waterfall,
over which hovers an iris, one of those frequent
decorations of Norwegian landscape which
a British islander but seldom sees in his be-fogged
home. Looking back, and following the stream
below with my eye, I perceive two figures approaching
the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“That’s my son and daughter,” exclaimed
Simon. “They are going to make hay on that
slope on the other side,” said he, pointing to a
little green spot high up the mountain.</p>

<p>If a crop was to be got there it would be one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
methought, such as the Scripture describes,
“with which the mower filleth not his hand, nor
he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom.” Such
little matters indicate the wrestle that mankind
here has to make both ends meet; in other words,
to get a supply of forage enough to last from
September to May.</p>

<p>“But there’s no bridge,” exclaimed I. “They
can’t get over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll manage.”</p>

<p>And sure enough I saw the boy first, and then
the girl, take off their shoes, and with a hop,
spring, and a jump, light on a stone standing out
in the torrent, and then on another; and so
over with the agility of mountain goats. One false
step&mdash;an easy matter when the rocks were so
slippery&mdash;and they would have endangered limb at
any rate, for the lin was deep, and worked up to
a dangerous pitch of exasperation by the knock-me-down
blows that its own gravity was giving it.</p>

<p>Before we emerge from the vast labyrinth of
mountain ruin, one overhanging fragment particularly
arrests my attention, for, under its eaves, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
quantity of martens had constructed their mud
habitations, and were darting out and athwart the
stream and back again with their muscipular
booty, with intense industry. The trout abound
in the brook that placidly flows through the little
green plain beyond; but, with such a host of
winged fly-catchers about, I doubt whether they
ever get into season. Here, taking advantage of
this little oasis of sweet grass, two or three sæters
had been constructed, with the cows and sheep
around them. The bald rock, up which our path
now lay, was of mica-slate, striped with bands of
white felspar; cold and grey, it was void of grass.
The beautiful ferns we had left nestling among the
clefts far behind, but a bit of stone-crop held its
own here and there, and the claret-stalked London
Pride asserted its dignity with much pertinacity.
There was also abundance of a red flower.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“Ah!” said Simon, as I picked up some specimens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
“it must be nigh thirty years ago that I
guided a Thelemarken priest over this Fjeld. He
told me the name of that ‘grass’ you’ve got there
(a Norwegian calls all flowers ‘grass’) but I don’t
mind it now. He had a large box with him, and
filled it full of grass and mosses. He was very
particular about that black moss under the snow.
His name was&mdash;let me see&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sommerfeldt,” suggested I, the well-known
author of the <i>Supplementum Floræ Laponicæ</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed Simon; “quite right.”</p>

<p>The inclined plane, up which we strode, was
clearly the work of a glacier. But though there
was no ice now, there were crevasses notwithstanding.
The mountain was traversed with deep
parallel fissures, from a few inches to two or three
feet in width. There might have been a score of
them&mdash;the widest spanned by little bridges of
stone, thrown across by the peasants for precaution’s
sake.</p>

<p>“Dangerous paths these on a dark night,” observed
I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and in broad daylight too,” was the
response.</p>

<p>“Mind how you go&mdash;it’s very slape. Do you
see that mark?” continued he, pointing to a long
scrawl on the slippery surface, which terminated
on the edge of one of these yawning chasms.
“The best horse in the valley made that. He
slipped in there, and was lost. Nabo (neighbour)
Ole’s ox did the same thing in another place. Forfaerdelig
Spraekke (frightful crack)! Pray take
care; let me go first. It will be very bad going,
I see, to-day. The snow is so much melted this
summer,” said he, as we scrambled down into a
deep basin, the bottom of which was occupied by
grim Stygian pools of snow-slush and spungy ice.
We were no sooner out of this slough of despond,
than we were on a quasi glacier, with its regularly-marked
dirt bands. The snow on which we trod
was honeycombed and treacherous. Underneath
it might be heard rumbling rills busily engaged in
excavating crevasses. Now and then one of them
came to the light of day, with that peculiar milky
tint of freshly-melted snow, as if the fluid was loth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to give up all at once its parent colour, dutiful
child. To add to the strangeness of the scene, the
sun, which was now high in heaven, catching the
face of the mica-slate, bronzed it into the colour
of the armour we have seen worn by the knights at
the Christmas pantomime.</p>

<p>“We call that Swerre’s Sok,” said my guide,
pointing to an eminence on my left, reminding me
that the brave Norsk king of that name, when pursued
by his foes, escaped with the remnants of his
army by this appalling route. “He took his sleeping
quarters at the sæter we are coming to,” continued Simon.</p>

<p>“That’s Yuklin,” said my cicerone, pointing to
a rounded mountain to the right, muffled in “a
saintly veil of maiden white,” and looking so calm
and peaceful amid the storm-tost stone-sea that
howled around us. To the left were two lesser
snow mountains, Ose Skaveln and Vosse Skaveln,
looking down on the scene of confusion at their
feet with no less dignity than their sister. Striking
images these of tranquil repose and rending passion!
It was a magnificent, still, autumn day; if it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
been otherwise, it would be difficult to imagine
what features the scene would have assumed. I
have seen a good deal of the Fjeld; but, until now,
I had no notion how it can look in some places.
“Vegetation has ceased now,” said the old man,
with a kind of shiver, which was quite contagious,
as we stumbled among</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Crags, rocks, and mounds, confusedly hurled,</div>
<div class="verse">The fragments of an earlier world.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But a common-place comparison may perhaps
bring what I saw home to my readers. Suppose a
sudden earthquake, or a succession of them, were
to rend, and prostrate, and jumble and tumble all
London, choking up the Thames with debris of all
imaginable shapes, and converting its bed into
deep standing pools, with now and then the
toppling tower of a temple or a palace reflecting
itself in the waters. And, to crown all, not a
single living mortal to be seen about the ruins. If
this will not suffice to illustrate the scene, the
blame must be laid on my barrenness of invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, after some miles of this amusement, we
came upon a broad, hollow way. To the right of
this path was the dark, soft, slaty micaceous schist,
but it came no further; and to the left of the line
was nothing but white granitic gneiss. A little
further on the rock was scorched.</p>

<p>“That’s the Torden,” said Simon; “a man was
struck by lightning here not so long ago.”</p>

<p>At last we emerged on a sort of stony moor, and
after eight hours’ walk suddenly got upon a small
plot of grass, and stopped at a châlet. I was not
sorry to preface an attack on my own stores by a
slight foray among the milky produce of the Fjeld
dairy. The curds (“Dravle” or “gum”) proved
excellent.</p>

<p>This spot was called Hallingskie, and was forty-two
English miles from the first farm in Hallingdal.
Hitherto, on the whole, we had got on pretty successfully,
though at a rather tortoise pace. It was
now that our misfortunes began. In the first place,
it was too late to think of achieving the passage of
the Fjeld by daylight. So we were to sleep at a
certain distant châlet; notwithstanding which Simon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seemed in no hurry to move; and it was only when
I started off alone that he bestirred himself, jabbering
as fast as possible to the old man and woman
who lived on this lonely spot. Presently we missed
our way, or rather direction&mdash;for there was no way
whatsoever&mdash;and lost much time in hitting off the
scent again. If we kept to the right, we got among
snow; if too much to the left, the valley was effectually
stopped up by inky lakes, laving the bases
of perpendicular cliffs. A shot or two at ptarmigan
somewhat enlivened the horrors of the scene.</p>

<p>At last, after many ups and downs and round-abouts,
we descend into a valley, and cross over a
deepish stream, both of us sitting on the horse.
Once on the further bank, I, of course, relieved the
horse of my weight. Not so my precious Norskman.
The unfortunate nag, pressed down by his bulk,
sunk at once almost to his hocks in the morass, and
only by a prodigious effort extricated himself, to
flounder back into the stream. Before I was aware
of it, to my consternation, I saw the poor creature
was getting into deep water, and then swimming,
only his mouth out of water, with all my baggage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
coat, gun, &amp;c., submerged. The wretched Simon,
who had never had the adroitness to throw himself
from the poor beast’s back, sat firmly upon him, just
like the Old Man of the sea on the back of Sinbad
the sailor&mdash;a proper incubus. Of course they’ll
both be drowned, thought I; but no! the poor
beast has secured a footing on the further side of
the water, and gradually emerges, all my traps
dripping gallons of water. My maps, and powder,
and gun, too, terrible thought! So much for the
pleasures of travelling in Norway.</p>

<p>Presently, the quadruped recrossed at the ford
above. After scolding the man most resolutely for
his carelessness, and adjusting the pack, which had
got under the horse’s belly, I proceeded. On we
trudged, I sulky beyond measure, and weary to
boot, but consoling myself with the thought of
being speedily at the châlet, where I might rest for
the night, and dry my effects. The shadows of the
mountains beginning to lengthen apace over the
dreary lake which we were now skirting, warned
me that the day was far spent. But still no
symptoms of a habitation. The way seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
interminable. At last, halting, I Old-Baileyed
the guide.</p>

<p>“How far have we to go?”</p>

<p>“Not so very far.”</p>

<p>“But night is coming on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall get there in a liden Stund (a little
while.)”</p>

<p>“Hvor er Stölen (where is the châlet)?”</p>

<p>“It ought to be near.”</p>

<p>“Ought to be! what do you mean? Haven’t
you been this road before?”</p>

<p>“No. But the stöl is near the second great
lake, and the second lake can’t be far. We’ve
passed the first.”</p>

<p>After this agreeable revelation I was wound up
into a towering state of ire, which made it prudent
not to say more.</p>

<p>Picking my way with difficulty through brooks,
and holes, and rocks, on I stumped. Twilight at
last became no-light, as we emerged on the side of
what seemed to be a lake. Here the châlet ought
to be. But whether or no, it was too dark to see.
Halting, the guide exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are we to do?”</p>

<p>“Do? why sleep under a rock, to be sure. Take
the load off the horse, and turn him loose. But
stop. Is not that the stöl?” exclaimed I, advancing
to a dark object, a few yards from us, when I
plunged up to my knees in a peat-hag, from which
I with difficulty extricated myself. Hitherto my
feet had been dry, but they were so no longer.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” I thundered out to
the guide, who kept chattering most vociferously,
and assuring me that the stöl ought to be
here.</p>

<p>“Listen! is not that a bell, on the side of the
hill?” We listened accordingly. Sure enough it
was the sound of a bell on the side of the mountain,
mingling with the never-ceasing hum of the
distant waterfalls. It must be some cattle grazing,
and the sæter could not be far off. “Try if you
can’t make your way up in the direction of the
sound. The building must be there.”</p>

<p>During the half-hour that my Sancho was absent,
I tramped disconsolately, like “the knight of the
sorrowful figure,” up and down a little square of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ground by the horse, to keep myself warm, as, besides
being wet, I sensibly felt the cold of the perpetual
snow which lay not far off. In due time
Simon returned. The solitary bell was that of a
horse, who was feeding on the slope, but no
sæter could he find.</p>

<p>“Can you holloa?” I exclaimed; “let’s holloa
both together.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, sir,” croaked he; “I have no voice.”
And now I perceived what I had before scarcely
noticed, that his voice did not rise above the compass
of a cracked tea-kettle. So, as a last resource, I
commenced a stentorian solo&mdash;“Wi har tabt Veien;
hvor er Stölen,”&mdash;(We have lost our way. Where
is the stöl?)&mdash;till the rocks rebellowed to the sound.
Suddenly I hear in the distance a sound as of many
cattle-bells violently rung, and then, as suddenly,
all the noise ceased.</p>

<p>“Strange that. Did you not hear it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Surely they were cattle.”</p>

<p>My guide’s superstitions, I fancy, began to be
worked on, and he said nothing. Neither did any
response come to my louder inquiries, except that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the echoes. There was nothing for it, then,
but to unload the horse, and take up a position
under the lee of some stone. The night was frosty,
and my pea-coat was wet through, with immersion
in the river. Nevertheless, I put it on, and over
all, the horse-rug, regular cold water-cure fashion.
Then, munching some of the contents of my
wallet, and drinking my last glass of brandy, I lit
a pipe. Before long, a bright star rose above the
mountain, and out twinkled, by degrees, several
other stars.</p>

<p>“The moon,” my man said, “must soon follow;”
but before her cold light was shed across the valley,
I had dozed off. At four o’clock I was awoke by
Simon, begging me to rise, which I felt very loth
to do. Awakened by the cold, he had got up, and
by the grey dawn had discovered the sæter, not
many hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>“My good Englishman, do get up, and dry
yourself,” he added, “they’ve lit a fire.”</p>

<p>Bobbing my head low, I entered the châlet. One
side of the small interior was occupied by a bed,
on which lay a woman with an infant in her arms,
while at the other end of the couch&mdash;heads and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
tails fashion&mdash;were a little boy and girl. The
other side of the den was occupied by shelves
covered with cheeses and vessels of milk, while
near the door was the hearth, on which some dried
juniper and willow bushes were crackling, under
the superintendence of the stalwart Hans, who
had left his helpmate’s side. Of course the good
folks bid me welcome, and bewailed my mischance;
and I felt as secure here, though quite alone, and
not a soul in England knew where I was, as if I
had been in my native country.</p>

<p>Taking a seat on the end of a box, which I
turned up for the purpose&mdash;the only seat in the
place&mdash;I commenced warming my outer man with
the blaze and smoke of the cabin, and my inner
with a kettle of hot tea. How fortunate it was
that I thought of taking a stock of it with me.</p>

<p>“Did not you hear me cry out, last night?”
asked I, when I had thawed a little.</p>

<p>“We heard a noise outside, and peeped out. All
the cattle sprang to their feet in great alarm; so
we thought it might be some wild animal. Afterwards,
we heard the sound repeated, and did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
know what to make of it. I didn’t like to venture
out.”</p>

<p>“You thought it was a troll, no doubt,” suggested
I, but did not press him on this point.</p>

<p>Reader, if you lived the life of these people, I’ll
venture to say that, were you as matter-of-fact a
body as ever lived, you would become infected with
a tinge of superstition in spite of yourself.</p>

<p>Presently Hans and his wife got up to milk the
cows, and we resumed our journey. There were
trout of three pound weight, I learned, in the dark
lake close by, but I had had quite enough of mountain
sojourn for the present. The next two or
three hours’ travel presented the same scenes as
before, savage in the extreme. Now snow, now
ice, now rocks splintered, riven asunder, cast upon
heaps, and ranged in fantastic groups, with now
and then a delicate anemone, red or white, and other
Alpine plants peeping modestly out of the ruins.</p>

<p>At last, emerging on a grassy slope, we saw, five
or six miles below us, the arm of the Sogne Fjord,
whither we were journeying. What a pleasure it
was to tread once more on a piece of flat road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
which we did at a place called Flom. More than
one Bauta stone erected to commemorate some
event, about which nobody knows anything at all,
is to be found here. Not long ago they were very
numerous; but these relics of a heathen race have
been gradually destroyed by the bonders. Offensive
and defensive armour is not unfrequently picked up
in the neighbourhood, so that this secluded valley
must have been at one time the scene of great
events.</p>

<p>Over the stream to the left, I see one of those
sand-falls so frequent in this country, and more
destructive to property than the snow avalanche.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
In an unlucky hour some sudden rain-storm washes
off the outer skin&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, grass, or herbage, of a
steep hill of loam or sand. From that hour the
sides of the hill keep perishing&mdash;nothing will grow
upon them, and every rain the earthy particles
keep crumbling off from the slope: thus, not only
curtailing the available land above, but damaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the crops below. Woe to the farmer who has a
mud or sand-fall of this description on his property.</p>

<p>Not sorry was I to darken the doors of Thorsten
Fretum, whose house stood on an eminence, commanding
a view up the valley and the Fjord.
Bayersk Oel and Finkel&mdash;old and good&mdash;raw ham,
eggs, and gammel Ost&mdash;a banquet fit for the gods&mdash;were
set before me. Thorsten Fretum is a man of
substance, and of intelligence to boot. He has
twice been member of parliament&mdash;one of the
twenty peasant representatives out of the aggregate
one hundred and four which compose the Storthing.
A person of enlightened views, he is especially
solicitous about the improvement of the means
of road-communication. At present, between the
capital, Christiania, and Bergen there are no less
than sixty miles of boating; fancy there being sixty
miles of sea voyage, and no other means of transit
between London and Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Mr. Fretum is well acquainted with the mountains,
and from him I learn that my guide has
brought me some twenty miles out of the right way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Mrs. Fretum, a nice-looking woman, wears the
regular peasant cap of white linen stiffly starched,
but of lighter make than those used in the Hardanger,
while round the forehead is fastened a dark
silk riband. She is the mother of fourteen sons,
some of whose small white heads I could see now
and then protruded through a distant door to get a
sight of the stranger.</p>

<p>Mr. Fretum catches large salmon in the river,
and exhibits flies of his own construction. A few
of mine will serve him as improved patterns, and
at the same time be an acknowledgment of his
hospitality.</p>

<p>The lyster, I find, is used, but as the river is not
of a nature to admit of boats, the weapon is secured
by a string to the wrist of the caster. I must not
omit to say that I deliberately fined my guide one
dollar for the injury I had sustained by his carelessness,
which he submitted to with a tolerably
good grace, evidently thinking I had let him off
very cheaply.</p>

<p>An old man and a young girl row me in the
evening to that most pretty spot, Urland. Here I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
find shelter at the merchant’s, just close to the
whitewashed church, which, according to tradition,
was originally a depôt for merchandize, and belonged
to the Hanse League. As I landed, a
crowd of peasants stood on the beach taking farewell
of a lot of drovers bound for the south. They
wore, instead of the national red cap, one of blue
worsted, adorned with two parallel white lines.
This is peculiar to parts of the Sogne district.
The Crown Prince, by-the-bye, enchanted the peasants
by purchasing one of the aforesaid red
nightcaps to take to Stockholm.</p>

<p>Didn’t I get up a good fire in the iron stove
which garnished one corner of the comfortable
room upstairs. With a palpitating heart I then
opened my box to investigate the amount of
damage done by the immersion. What a sight!
Those carefully starched white shirts and collars
which I had expressly reserved for the period when
I should get back to towns and cities, limper than
the flexible binding of the guide-book. The books,
too, and maps humid throughout; the ammunition
nearly in the same plight; while those captain-biscuits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
on which I counted, were converted into
what I should imagine was very like baby-food,
though I am not skilled in those matters.</p>

<p>There was no need of the cup of cold water,
which travelling Englishmen so often insist on
placing near the red-hot thirty-six pounders (<i>i.e.</i>,
iron German stoves) for the purpose of neutralising
the dryness of the atmosphere in the apartment,
for I was soon in a cloud of steam rising from the
drying effects.</p>

<p>The <i>Morgen-Bladt</i>, I see, still continues to give
accounts of the Crown Prince’s progress. He has
been examining some extensive draining operations
near Molde, much to the wonderment of the
peasants.</p>

<p>“I trow the king’s son knows as much about
these things as the best farmer among us,”
said a red-capped bonder to another in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Ay, and a vast deal more, let me tell thee,
neighbour Ole.” And then a strapping youth
exclaims,</p>

<p>“How sorry I am that I’ve served out my time
under the king (<i>i.e.</i>, as a soldier); I finished last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
year. It must be sheer holiday work to serve
under such a bonny lad as that.”</p>

<p>The Viceroy continually indulges in harmless
pleasantries with the good folks, without any loss
of dignity by thus unbending. Can any one tell
me why things are so different in England? When
Shakspeare said “that a sort of divinity hedges a
king,” he did not mean to say that royalty should
be iced. I remember many years ago being at a
public masked ball at a continental capital when
the King, who was good humouredly sauntering
all among the maskers, came up and asked me
what character my dress represented, and then
made some witty <i>apropos</i> as he passed on through
the crowd.</p>

<p>The usual explanation given for the sharper
distinction of ranks in Great Britain is the vulgarity
and want of <i>savoir faire</i> of the less elevated
classes, who, if they get an inch, will take an ell. If
this is true, it is a great blot on the Anglo-Saxon,
or whatever you call it, character, that an Englishman
cannot take some middle place between flunkeyism
and forwardness, sycophancy and rudeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>During the evening I am favoured with a visit
from the Lehnsman, who informs me that the
stream close by is rented by an Englishman, who
never comes, although it holds good salmon. I
also learn, that by a very wise regulation, which
might be imitated with good effect in England, he
has to report annually to the chief government
officer of the district (1), upon the amount of
grain sown; (2), the prospects of the harvest; (3),
on the result of the harvest. This enables the
authorities and merchants to regulate their measures
accordingly, and neither more nor less grain
is imported than is necessary.</p>

<p>Mons and Illing were the names of the two
clever boatmen who manned our skiff the next day
to Leirdalsören, distant nearly forty miles. Rounding
a vast cliff, whose sides were so steep as not to
afford a particle of foothold in case of need, the
bark bounds merrily along before a regular gale,
and we lose sight very soon of the peaceful Urland,
and descry another little green spot, Underdal,
with its black chapel of ease to the mother
church. Lower down on the same side we open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the entrance to Neri Fjord, guarded by stupendous
limestone bluffs; one of these is black with
the exposure of many thousand years, and nearly
perpendicular. But the most picturesque is the
western portal, where in parts the white rock has
become turned into a beautiful purple, diversified
here and there by patches of green foliage.</p>

<p>I should not have liked to be here on a sun-shiny
day, just after dame Nature had completed
the operation of opening the white limestone. A
pair of green spectacles would have been much
needed to take off the edge of the glare. That
street in Marseilles (see <i>Little Dorrit</i>), the minute
description of the glare and heat of which reminds
one of the tautological pie-man, “all hot, hot&mdash;hot
again!” must have been nothing to it.</p>

<p>Many eagles have made these fastnesses their
dwelling-places, and I hear from the boatmen they
commit frequent ravages among the sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Of aquatic birds, red-throated divers are the
only ones we see. Indeed, in this part of Norway,
the traveller misses the feathered multitudes that
are to be seen within the Arctic circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>But the wind has suddenly failed us, and the
five hours, in which we were to accomplish the
distance, will infallibly expand into ten; for to
our left lies Simla Naze, which is only half way;
and the sun resting on its arid peak tells us it is
already five o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, although we started before
mid-day. Hence we see far down the Fjord to
seaward. Yonder is Fresvik, the snow lying on
the mountain above illuminated in a wonderful
manner by the shooting rays of the sun, which is
itself hidden behind a mist-robe. Further seaward,
at least a dozen miles from here, may be
plainly seen the yellow corn-fields about Systrand,
near which is Sognedal, famous for its large Bauta
stones.</p>

<p>We now veer round sharp to the eastward, and
enter another arm of the immense Fjord. To our
right lies the farm-house of Froningen, and behind
it a large pine-forest&mdash;a rare sight about here&mdash;where
the timber has been ruthlessly exterminated
by the improvident peasants. This forest, consequently,
which is seven English miles square,
and the property of a single peasant, is of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
value. Our mast, which has hitherto been kept
standing, in the vain hope of the breeze revisiting
us at this point, is now unshipped; and I unship
that most astonishing contrivance, the rudder,
with its tiller a yard and a-half long. It was with
such an instrument that King Olaf split open the
skull of the son of Hacon Jarl.</p>

<p>As we approach Leirdal, the boat takes the
ground a good distance from the landing-place.
The detritus brought down from the Fille-Fjeld by
the rapid Leirdal river, is gradually usurping the
place of what was, some years ago, deep water.
And yet, notwithstanding the shallowness and the
great mass of fresh water coming in, there is less
ice here in winter than at Urland, where the water
is immensely deep, and much more salt. Indeed,
the natural phenomena of this country are frequently
inexplicable.</p>

<p>The throng of great, ill-fed looking peasants, who
crowded the humble pier of piles, eager for a job,
told tales of a numerous population with little to
do. Although it was already night in this dark
defile, jammed in between overshadowing mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
I forthwith order a carriole, and drive up
the road.</p>

<p>“Do you go to school?” I asked of my boy-attendant.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lars Anders. “We must all go
for six years, from eight to fourteen; that is to say,
for the six winter months, from Martinmas to
Sanct Johann’s Tid (Midsummer.) After that, we
go to the clergyman’s for six months, to receive
religious instruction.”</p>

<p>At Midlysne, where I spent the night, some
hermetically sealed provision boxes indicate a
visit from Englishmen, who have been catching
salmon here. But the increased rate of charges
would of itself have suggested something of the
kind.</p>

<p>A boy met us on the road next morning with
three fine salmon on his back. He had caught
them in a deep hole, near Seltum Bridge, and
offers them for sale at twopence a pound. The
salmon go up as far as Sterne Bridge, and are
then stopped by a defile, where the torrent is
choked up by masses of fallen rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>From Husum station my attendant is a very
small boy, who with difficulty manages to clamber
up on his seat behind. As we commence the
ascent of the remarkable road which surmounts the
tremendous pass beyond, a deep bass voice sounds
close to my ear, startling me not a little. I’ll tell
you what, reader, you would have started too, if a
voice like that had sounded in your ears on such a
spot, with no person apparently near, or in sight,
that could be the owner of it. Could it come
from that tiny urchin? Yet such was the case.
Halvor Halvorsen was sixteen years of age,
although no bigger than a boy of eight. The
cause of his emitting those hollow tones was,
that he wished to descend from his perch and walk
up the pass, which he cannot do unless the vehicle
is stopped; as if such a shrimp as that would
make any possible difference to the horse. I
suppose he has heard that the last ounce will break
the camel’s back. His nickname is Wetle, the
sobriquet of all misbegotten imps in this country.
He cannot spell, and is nearly daft, poor child; but
for voice, commend me to him. The whip he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
carries is nearly as long as himself; while his
dress is exactly of the fashion worn by adults.</p>

<p>Further on the road branches in two directions;
that to the left goes over the Fille-Fjeld. We take
that to the right, and mount the Hemsedal’s Fjeld,
and are soon on the summit. Some miserable-looking
châlets dot the waste. One of these,
Breitestöl, professes to give refreshment; but I
did not venture within its forbidding precincts.
The juniper scrub has in many places been caught
by the frost, studding the wilderness of grey rock,
and yellow reindeer moss, with odd-looking patches
of russet. A series of sleet showers, which the
wind is driving in the same direction as I am
going, ever and anon spit spitefully at me. High
posts at intervals indicate the presence here, for
many months in the year, of deep, deep snow,
when everything is under one uniform white,
wedding-cake covering; funeral crust, I should
rather say, to the unfortunate traveller, who
chances to wander from the road, and gets submerged.
Everything looks dreary in the extreme;
the very brooks seem no longer to laugh joyously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
as they come tumbling down from the heights.
There is a dull hoarse murmur about them to-day,
whether it is the state of the atmosphere, or the
state of the wind, or the state of my own spirit at
the moment, I know not; perhaps they are loth to
leave the parental tarns for the lowlands. The
bosom of mamma yonder is also ruffled, I see, into
uneasy motion. The writer of <i>Undine</i> ought to
have been here to embody the imaginings suggested
by the scene.</p>

<p>I was all alone, my attendant having gone back
with another traveller. Presently, I meet a solitary
peasant girl, sitting in masculine fashion on a
white pony. The stirrups are too long, so she has
inserted her toes in the leathers. It struck me
that the lines in the nursery rhyme&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">This is the way the ladies ride,</div>
<div class="verse">This is the way the gentlemen ride,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">will have to be inverted for the benefit of Norsk
babies. The damsel stares at me with much
astonishment, and I stare at her, and, as we pass
each other, a “good morning” is exchanged. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
now the water-shed is passed, as I reach an old
barrow, which appears to have been opened; and I
dart down hill in company with a swiftly coursing
stream, the beginning of the Hemsedal River.</p>

<p>Yonder to the left, auspicious sight, stands the
change house of Bjöberg. I am soon in the Stuê,
eating mountain trout, and regaling myself with
Bayersk Öl, and then coffee. The biting cold,
although August was not yet over, sharpened
my appetite. The waiters, who alternately bustled
in and out of the room, were a thickset burly man,
wearing a portentously large knife, with a weather-beaten,
“old red sandstone” sort of countenance;
and a female, dressed in the hideous fashion of
the country, her waist under her armholes; a
fashion none the less hideous from her being in an
interesting condition. These two were the landlord,
Knut Erickson Bjöberg, and his spouse,
Bergita.</p>

<p>Warmed by the repast, I have leisure to survey
the apartment. There were the usual amount of
carved wooden spoons, painted bowls and boxes,
but the prints upon the log-walls were what chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
engaged my attention. One of these was “The
Bible map of the way to Life and Death.” A
youth, in blue coat and red stockings, is beheld
on the one side, bearing a cross. After a series of
most grotesque adventures, he arrives at heaven’s
gate, and is admitted by angels, who crown him with
a chaplet. On the other side of the picture is a
sort of “Rake’s Progress.” A man is seen dancing
with a lady in a flame-coloured dress. Garlands,
drinking, and fighting, are the order of the day.
At last a person in black, with red toes and red
horns, appears. There is a door into a lion’s
mouth, and, amid flames burning, evil spirits are
descried. In another picture the “Marriage of
Cana,” is described not less graphically, and with
equal attention to costume. The <i>bizarre</i>&mdash;an
educated person would pronounce it profane&mdash;treatment,
one would think, must sadly mar the
good moral of the story. Knut was a most intelligent
fellow, as I detected at a glance, and so I
prevailed upon him to schuss me to the next station,
Tuf, instead of sending a stupid lad.</p>

<p>“This is a strange wild country you live in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Knut,” said I, when we had driven a little distance.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it is rather. What countryman are
you, if I may be so bold?”</p>

<p>“Guess.”</p>

<p>“To judge from the fishing-rod and the gun,
you must be an Englishman. I once guided an
Englishman&mdash;let me see&mdash;one Capitan Biddul
(Biddulph?) over the mountains to the Sogne
Fjord. Capitan Finne, too, the Norwegian Engineer,
when he was surveying, I was a good deal
with him.”</p>

<p>“Do the people hereabouts believe in the hill-folk?”
(Haugefolk = fairies).</p>

<p>“To be sure. There used to be a strange man
living at Bjöberg before my father took to the
place; one Knut Sivardson Sivard. His head was
full of those hill-people. He used to tell an odd
tale of a circumstance that happened to him years
ago. One Yule, when he was just going to rest,
came a tap at the door. ‘Who is there?’ he asked.
‘Neighbours,’ was the reply. Opening the door,
he let in three queer-looking people, with pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
white caps and dark clothes. ‘I’m Torn Hougesind,’
said one, with a swarthy face and a hideous
great tooth in the middle of his upper jaw. ‘I’m
your nearest neighbour.’ ‘I’m Harald Blaasind,’
said another. ‘I’m’&mdash;I forget what the other
called himself, but it was like the other two names,
the name of some of those mountains near by.
‘Strange that I never saw you before,’ said Sivard,
doubtfully. ‘But we don’t live so far off; we’ve
called in to see how you do this Yule time.’ Sivard
did not like the appearance of matters, but said
nothing, and set before them some Yule ale in a
large birch bowl, such as we use for the purpose in
these parts. How they did drink, those three
fellows! But Hougesind beat the rest hollow.
Every now and then, as the ale mounted to his
brain, the creature laughed, and showed his monster
tooth.”</p>

<p>“A modern <i>Curius Dentatus</i>,” mused I.</p>

<p>“Presently, in mere wantonness, he bit the board,
saying, he would leave a mark of his visit. Sivard’s
son, Knut, who was a determined young fellow,
lay in bed all this while, and rightly judged that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the ale flowed at this pace, there would be very little
left for the remainder of the Christmas festivities.
So he slily reached his gun, which hung on the
wall, and taking good aim, fired right at Hougesind,
him with the tooth, when the whole three
vanished in a twinkling! Sivard used to show
the mark of the tooth in the board, but I have
heard that it looked just as if it had been made by
a horse tooth hammered into it. However, the
tale got all over the country, and folks used to
come up from Christiania to see Sivardson Sivard,
and hear the description of what he had seen.</p>

<p>“Fond of a joke was Sivard. There is a patch
of grass you passed up the road&mdash;a very scarce
article hereabouts. Drovers used to stop there
unbeknown to him, and give their cattle a bellyful,
and then came and took a glass at the house, and
said nothing about it. He was determined to be
even with them; so he dressed up a guy with an
old helmet on, and a sword in his hand, and placed
the figure close by a hovel there. Not many nights
after, a drover came rushing into the house almost
senseless with fright. ‘He is coming, he is coming!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the Lord deliver me!’ ‘What now?’ exclaimed
Sivard. The drover explained that he was coming
along, when he spied a man in armour, with dreadful
glaring eyes and sword, rushing after him.
He ran for his life. It was one of the Hill folk.
‘Are you certain he moved?’ inquired Sivard,
ready to burst with laughter. ‘Quite certain.’
‘But where were you?’ ‘Oh! I had just turned
out of the road a bit, to give the horses a bite of
grass’&mdash;‘that did not belong to you,’ continued the
other. ‘Serve you right for trespassing.’</p>

<p>“But we all believe in these people up here,”
continued my companion. “Not so very long ago,
Margit and Sunniva&mdash;two sæter girls&mdash;just when
they were leaving with the cattle for home, at the
end of the summer, saw two little trolls steal into
the deserted hut. They observed them accurately.
They were dressed in red, with blue caps, and each
had a pipe and a neat little cane.”</p>

<p>“And do these people ever do harm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Sometimes they injure the cattle,
and make people ill. There are some women who
are skilled in breaking the charm. They are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
‘Signe-kone’ (from signe, to exorcise, and kone,
woman). One or two such live in the valley.
They are considered better than any doctor for a
sore.”</p>

<p>“And what is their method of cure?”</p>

<p>“Why, they smear something over the place,
and say a few words, and blow (blaese). Blowing
is an important part of the ceremony. They measure
children, too, from head to foot; that is a
good thing.”</p>

<p>“And what sort of people,” asked I, “are there
in the valley?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I can’t say much for them. I’m the
vorstand (a kind of churchwarden or parish trustee),
so I know something about it. The priest,
not long ago, told them from the pulpit that there
were more bastards born, than children in lawful
wedlock. But they don’t care. It’s all Brantvun
that does it. I’ve seen lads come to church with a
bottle of brandy, and, directly it’s over, give the
girls a drink. Hard work for the clergyman, I believe
you. But Pastor Engelstrup&mdash;you’ve heard
of him no doubt;&mdash;he was the man to manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
them. Prodigiously strong he was. When he was
building his gaard at Gool, there was a beam three
of them were trying to lift on the roof, but couldn’t.
‘Let me try,’ said he, and raised the timber without
more ado. He is gone up to Aal, in Hallingdal
now. We missed him very much. He
was as good as he was strong.”</p>

<p>“Is he a big man?”</p>

<p>“No, not so very; but he is very thickset, with
curly black hair, now got grey.”</p>

<p>I find that Knut gets pretty well paid for maintaining
a change-house in such a solitary spot as
Bjöberg. The Government allows him three hundred
dollars per annum for keeping the house open
for travellers through the year, besides thirty dollars
for every horse. He and others, he tells me, are
endeavouring to get the Storthing to advance
money for the purpose of rendering the river navigable
to Naes, which might be done at an inconsiderable
expense.</p>

<p>After a continued descent, we arrive at Tuff.
Here a pale-faced little tatterdemalion offers to
dance the Halling dance for the sum of two skillings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
They have a marvellous way in this national dance
of flinging their legs high up into the air (the Hallingkast),
and twisting the body a couple of times
round, horizontally, in the air. Some peasant girls
in green skirts, with no cincture, fastened over
their shoulders with braces,&mdash;their yellow hair surmounted
by a red ‘buy-a-broom-girl’-shaped cap,
are among the bystanders. The first course over,
the lad tells me he is very poor, and begs me for
some pig-tail tobacco to chew, which I was unable
to give him.</p>

<p>I find that the peasants hereabouts keep two
thousand tame reindeer, but they are not found to
answer.</p>

<p>As we coursed down the road from Tuff to Ekre,
a new station, my schuss, Ingval Olsen, points out
by the waning light, to some large stones that
strewed the Fjeld to the left.</p>

<p>“There was a gaard there, Gytogaard, under the
mountain fifty years ago,” said he; “but one night,
when all were a-bed, the mountain came down and
buried them all. Some human voices were heard for

days long, and then all was still. No human
labour could have extricated them.”</p>

<p>Further in the wood a spot was shown me where
a man was found murdered some time back, and
nobody ever found out who did it, or who the
murdered man was&mdash;a region of horrors.</p>

<p>Next morning I found my schuss-karl was brimful
of tales, which he firmly believed, about the
trolls.</p>

<p>“You see that Fjeld,” said he, pointing to a
magnificent abrupt mountain behind us. “A friend
of mine was taken in there on Yule night, and
feasted with the hill people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>I hummed to myself, as I thought of <i>Young
Tamlane</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The queen of fairies keppit him</div>
<div class="verse">In yon green hill to dwell.</div>

<p>“They wanted,” continued he, “to keep him
altogether, but he got away notwithstanding. Cari
Olsdatter, my sister, was changed in the cradle too
when my mother had gone out one evening; but she
came back just in time to see an old woman carrying
off the baby, and made her give it up. There
was a bag of stones left in the cradle instead.</p>

<p>“Torkil Hermandson, too, who lived among the
hills, they say he was married to a troll-qvind (‘elf-quean,’
as a Lowlander would say), called Turi
Hougedatter. She was to have for her dowry his
fold, as full as it would hold, of fat troll-cattle.
So he set to work the night before, and wattled in
twice as much ground as his fold usually covered.
Sly fellow was Hermandson.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” thought I, “it seemed almost as if
he was taking a leaf out of dame Dido’s book, when
she over-reached the simple aborigines of Africa
with her ox-hide <i>double entendre</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>My attendant has got in his harvest, so he has
comparatively little for the horse to do, and offers
to schuss me all the way to Naes, which offer I
accept. Presently we descend the hill at Gool,
the former residence of the Samsonian Gielstrup.</p>

<p>“You see that hillock yonder, covered with firs,”
said my guide, pointing to a spot lying at the
confluence of the Hemsedals Elv and that of
Hallingdal. “There it was where Arne Hafthorn
wrestled with a troll one Christmas Eve, and got
from him the great drinking horn, which has been
in the family ever since. But it brought him no
good. There has always been one of the family
stumm (dumb) or halv-vittig (half-witted); and it
is not so many years ago that Arne was found
dead close by the hill there. This horn is still to
be seen at a farm-house a little way up Hallingdal.
It is made of ox-horn, and mounted with some
unknown metal, and rests on a stand. Ah! you
smile, but it is all virkelig sant (actually true).”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what do you do for the fairies at Yule?”
said I.</p>

<p>“Oh! we always place some cake and ale on the
board when we go to bed at night.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what then? Do they partake of it?”</p>

<p>“To be sure! It’s always gone in the morning.
No doubt it is taken by the ‘hill people.’ Merry
time is Yule. We brew ale for the occasion, and
bake a large cake, which we keep till Twelfth
Night. Everybody stops at home on Christmas
Day; but on the day after everybody goes out to
visit everybody, and if you meet a person you
always say, ‘Glaedelig Jule’ (a happy Yule to you).”</p>

<p>At Haga a different sort of head-dress begins to
prevail among the male peasants, being a skull-cap
of red cloth, like that worn by the Kirghis chiefs,
as sketched by Atkinson, with stripes of black
velvet radiating from the crown to the edge. Instead
of the usual jacket, a green frock is worn,
with stand-up collar, and an epaulet of the same
coloured cloth on the shoulders.</p>

<p>A grove of beautiful birches here overhangs the
two streams, now joined in one fine river, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
abounds with trout, some of which reach the weight
of six pounds and upwards. The fly and bait are
both used, I understand. At Naes there is very
good accommodation at the “Merchant’s,” including
excellent wine and fresh meat. Part of the church
here is seven hundred years old, and there are one
or two old pillars and a trefoil arch at the east end
worth observing. The altar piece, representing the
crucifixion, is by no means contemptible.</p>

<p>From here boats may be procured right down the
stream to Green, on the Krören Fjord, some fifty
miles. Every now and then the stream widens into
a lake, and at times narrows into a cataract, so
that a skilful boatman is required. This is by far
the best way of proceeding; but the peasants are
not bound by law to forward you otherwise than on
the high road; so, finding there was some difficulty,
I took horse and gig, thereby missing some excellent
shooting and fishing. Trout of ten pounds are taken
here, and there are numbers of ducks. Oats begin
now to be cultivated instead of the hardier barley.</p>

<p>The plump, red-faced damsel who routed me
out of bed in the morning, at the wretched station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of Sevre, had actually a row of five silver brooches
confining the shirt over her exuberant bust. But this
is nothing to the jacket with fifty silver clasps, which
one of the ancient Scalds is narrated to have worn.</p>

<p>As I journeyed along, on a most lovely quiet
autumn morning, the road would every now and
then pierce into a thick pine wood, and then emerge
upon the banks of the stream. More tempting
spots for trout-fishing I never saw. All the horses
about here, I find, come from the north of the
Fjeld, few being bred in the valley. They almost
invariably get a kind of influenza on coming south.
The horse I am driving, which was bought at
Leirdalsören for fifty dollars in the spring, is only
just recovering from an attack of this kind.</p>

<p>At Trostem I find a bear has been seen five or
six times, but there is no shooter about.</p>

<p>While I wait for the horse, I eat breakfast, and
look about me. Wonderful to relate, I find on a
shelf&mdash;what do you suppose, reader?&mdash;a Bible!
yes, that was there, but there was another volume,
a cookery book, printed at Copenhagen, 1799.
One might as well expect to meet with a book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Paris fashions among the squaws of the Ojibbeways.
Eating, it is true, forms the main part of a
Norwegian’s daily thoughts. The word mad (meat,
food) is everlastingly in their mouths, and the
thing itself almost as frequently, six meals a day
not being uncommon. But then, what food! No
cookery book surely required for that. So that
no doubt this book got here by mistake.</p>

<p>The little almanac, edited by Professor Handsteen,
of Christiania, who is known in England as
the author of “Travels in Siberia,” also lay on the
table. A little note I found in it is very significant
of the simple-minded superstition that still
lingers among the peasantry, of which I have been
giving indications above. It is to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The orbit of the moon (maane-bane), has the
same position with regard to the equator every nineteenth
year, and it possibly may influence the
atmosphere. It has been supposed, in consequence,
that there is some similarity in the weather on any
day to that of the corresponding day nineteen years
ago. For this reason, in one column under the
heading ‘veirliget,’ the weather is given as observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
at Christiania, nineteen years ago. This,
however, must not be looked on as divination
(ingen spædom), but only as an historical calculation.”
This veirliget (weather) column having, notwithstanding
the above caution, been turned by the
peasants to superstitious uses, was, I hear, omitted
for a time, but it had to be restored, as the bonders
would not buy the almanac without it. I may here
mention that the old dispute about the exact day on
which St. Olaf fell at Stikklestad has been recently
revived with great vigour. This great national festival
has hitherto been kept on the 29th of July,
“Olsok.” Hakon Hakonson was crowned king on
that day in 1247, and ever since it has been the
coronation day of Norway. But the national mind
was some time ago disagreeably disturbed by the
discovery that the 29th could not after all have
been the day of St. Olaf’s death; for although tradition
and Snorro assert that there was an eclipse
of the sun on that day, it has been ascertained
by astronomical calculation, that this eclipse did
not take place on the 29th July, but on the 31st of
August. One party, therefore, is contending for
the observance of the festival on the actual day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
(31st of August), while another insists upon adhering
to the former date. Upon the whole, it
would seem preferable to observe the day hallowed
by the traditional recollections of the people. If
we may be permitted such a comparison, who would
like to see the festival of the Nativity altered
from December 25th to some other day in the
calendar?</p>

<p>Meantime, after an unusual delay, the fresh relay
arrives; a fine black stallion, dripping wet.</p>

<p>“I must write a complaint in the book for this,”
said I. “You are long after your time. I shall
never get to the end of my journey at this rate.
You’ll be fined a dollar, and serve you right.”</p>

<p>“Oh! pray don’t, sir; it’s not my fault; the
landlord’s son is to blame; he never comes
straight to tell us. And then the horse was over
the river. I’ve had to swim him across, and the
water is bad just now for swimming. He shall go
fast, and make up for lost time.”</p>

<p>Somewhat mollified, I did not put my threat
in execution, much to the satisfaction of Svend.</p>

<p>Svend was a simple-minded individual in shooting
matters, as I presently had occasion to see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
On the sedgy shallows of a lake, just before the
river began again to contract into rapids, a score
of ducks were assembled; some motionless, others
busily employed in standing on their heads in the
water. Leaving the carriole, I stole with much circumspection
towards them, managing to keep some
bushes between me and the birds, until I got within
shot. Bang went one barrel, and then another,
and four ducks were <i>hors de combat</i>. When I
returned to the vehicle with my prize, Svend expressed
great astonishment that I had fired the
barrels separately, as he thought they both went
off at once.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He had never seen a double-barrelled
gun before. Another peasant who was by,
speedily cut some birch twigs with his toll-knife,
and packed up the birds, taking care to stick the
bills inside, that the flies might not get into the
gape (Gapë).</p>

<p>At length we descend upon Gulsvig, at the head
of the Krören Fjord. I at once perceived, from a
glance at the interior of the house, that the station-keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was a man of some importance. In fact, he
turned out to be the Lehnsman of the district. In
the inner room there were a large quantity of silver
spoons, and a huge tankard of solid silver, pegged
inside, and of great weight, which at once bespoke
the owners to be people of substance.</p>

<p>“Ah! that was left me by my grandfather,” said
the landlord. “It has been a very long time in
the family.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any curious remains about
here?” inquired I; “any bauta-stones, for instance,
or do you know any legends?”</p>

<p>“There is a bauta-stone up yonder in the field;
but as for legends, old Moer can tell you a lot of
stories about the hill-folk, but she is not always in
the humour.”</p>

<p>Gamle Moer (old mother), as he called her,
Anna Olsdatter Gulsvig, just then entered the
room with a pipe in her mouth. An excellent
portrait of her, by a Norwegian artist, hung against
the wall. Her tall figure was still erect, her eye
undimmed, while her face, the complexion of which
years had failed to sear, preserved traces of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
former beauty. A neat white cap, bound tight round
with a red silk kerchief, confined her grey locks.
On her bosom were two or three pairs of silver
studs, and the national ornament, the sölje. The
one which she wore was of the size and shape of a
small saucer. It was of silver filigree-work, with a
quantity of silver saucers (or bracteates), each about
half an inch in diameter, hung to it. Similar ornaments
have been found, I believe, in barrows; the
pattern of them having probably been imported
hither by the Varangian guard from Byzantium
and the East; in the same way that these Northern
mercenaries probably gave the first idea of the
Scandinavian-looking trinkets which have been
recently discovered in the tombs at Kertch.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mrs. Anna?” so I accosted
the old lady, propitiating her by the offer of some
tobacco. “I hear you have some old stories; will
you tell me one?”</p>

<p>“I can’t awhile now; besides, I’ve forgotten
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but now do, Moer,” supplicated a little
boy, her grandson. But the old lady left the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Presently, however, she came in again. There was
a look of inspiration in her clear grey eye, which
seemed to betoken that my desire would be granted.</p>

<p>“It’s some Huldra stories ye were wanting to
hear?” said she in an odd dialect; “well, I’ll just
tell you one before I go and cook your dinner; you
must be hungry. Let me see; yes, I once did see
one of the Houge-folk.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! how was that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it’s many years ago. I am an
old woman now, over seventy. Then I was a lass
of eighteen. It was one Thursday evening in
September, and I was up at the sæter. Two other
girls had come in, and we thought we would have
a dance&mdash;and so we danced up and down the floor.
The door was open, when suddenly I saw outside,
staring fixedly at us, a little man, with brown
breeches, grey coat, and a red cap on his head. He
was very fat, and his face, it looked so dark, so dark.
What a fright I was in to be sure, and the other
girls too. As soon as we saw him, we left off
dancing, you may depend upon it, directly. The
next moment he was gone, but the other girls durst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
not go to their sæters, though they were only a few
yards off. We all sat crouching over the fire for
the rest of the night.” Rapt into days of old, the
intelligent eye of the old lady gleamed like a Sibyl’s,
as she told her story, with much animation. At the
same time, she placed her hand, half unconsciously,
as it seemed, on mine, the little boy all the while
drinking in the tale with suspended breath and
timid looks; reminding me of the awful eagerness
with which Béranger, I think, describes the grandchildren
listening to some old world story of grandmamma’s.
A capital scene it was for a picture&mdash;the
group is still before me.</p>

<p>“You must have been mistaken,” said I.</p>

<p>“Not at all. That’s not the only time I’ve seen
a Tuss.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! How was that?”</p>

<p>“One time I was up at the sæter with Turi,
another girl. We were just going to bed, when a
stave was put through the little window-pane (gluggen),
and moved gently backwards and forwards.
We were frightened at first, but we heard a titter
outside, and then we knew directly what it meant.
It was two Friers (lovers) come, so we got up and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
them in, and we were soon all four in bed together.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed I, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the way we have here. Of course,
you know we were dressed.”</p>

<p>“And were you married to the man afterwards?”</p>

<p>“No; I married quite another person.”</p>

<p>“I did just the same,” put in her son, the Lehnsman,
who had just entered. “We see no harm in
that. A young farmer’s son often sleeps with a
companion in this way, but she must be of the same
rank of life as he is. If it was with a servant girl,
it would be considered a disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Well, but go on with your story,” said I to
the narrator.</p>

<p>“Where was I? Let me see. Yes, we were in
bed all snug, chatting away, when suddenly I heard
a noise at the window. ‘Hush!’ whispered I&mdash;‘what’s
that? Listen.’</p>

<p>“We saw at this moment a pole put through the
window, just like before. What a fright we were
in. But we lay quite still. Presently the pole
was drawn back, and a minute after there was a
terrible noise in the fiös among the cattle&mdash;a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
lowing and bellowing, just as if one of them was
being killed. Up we all got in a trice, and rushed
out, and I saw a tuss stroking a black cow. It was
in a muck sweat; this is as true as I sit here. It
was at Nor-sæter, a mile from the farm in Signedal,
where I lived before I was gift (married) up here.”</p>

<p>“What is that tale about the goat, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ah! At Fagerlid, in Eggedal, a woman
came one evening with a white female goat, and
begged the master to change it for a buck. He
declined. She came again three Thursday evenings
running, till at last he consented. They knew pretty
well who she must be, for they saw something like
the end of a tail behind her. So, when she went
away, they cast a toll-knife after her, to prevent any
evil consequences. They never repented the change;
the female goat she left gave such an astonishing
quantity of milk. As for the person who brought
her, they never saw her again.”</p>

<p>“But there are no tusser now-a-days?” inquired
I.</p>

<p>With a mysterious look the old lady took a pinch
of snuff, and started off talking again, to the great
delight of the small urchin; and so fast did she talk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that it was only by extraordinary attention, and stopping
her now and then for an explanation of her antique
dialect, that I succeeded in mastering the story.</p>

<p>“To be sure there are; people are seeing them
constantly. It is only ten years ago, that on the
evening after Christmas, Hans Östenson, of Melbraten-gaard,
three-quarters of a mile above Trostem,
which you passed, heard a terrible noise in
the fiös (byre). He thought that the cows and
sheep must have got together. So he lit a torch,
and went out to see; but directly he came into the
byre all was quiet in a moment, and the cattle
were in their right places. The man, suspecting
glamour, took effectual means to put a stop to it,
by immediately striking his axe into the beam over
the door of the cattle-shed.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Meantime Hans’ wife,
who was sick in bed, observed a crowd of little people
hustle into the house as soon as her husband was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
out of it, and lay dunen (bedding of eider-down)
for themselves on the floor, and betake themselves
to repose. She kept quite still. Presently the
master returned with the news that ‘It’s all
right; no harm done;’ at the same moment he
claps his eyes on the little people stretched on
the floor. ‘Holloa, my masters! What now?’
said he, in a jovial tone, having drunk a tolerable
quantity of Yule ale that evening. ‘Who are you, and
whither bound?’ ‘We’ve had a long journey of it,’
replied one of the little people, rousing up, in somewhat
shrill tones. ‘We’ve come all the way from
Kongsberg town. We’ve been to the doctor there.’
‘Why so?’ ‘Why, Mars Hulte (the servant of
the gaard), when he was pouring the ale from the
vat into the barrel, the other evening, let the
cullender drop on the leg of one of our people,
who happened to be near, though Hulte did not
see him, and hurt it sorely. We want to stop
here to-night; besides which, we wish to have a
talk with you.’ ‘Very good,’ said Hans, not a
whit disconcerted; ‘make yourselves at home;
you seem to be acquainted with the house already.
Just look out there, while I step into bed!’ And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
forthwith he picked his way, with much circumspection,
between the prostrate forms of the tiny
people. This was no easy matter, as they lay so
close together upon the floor. But he gained the
bed, fortunately without doing any more damage
than treading on the tip of one oldish fellow’s toe,
who set up a sharp scream.</p>

<p>“‘Well, and where do you live?’ said Hans,
resuming his place under the skin (fell) by the side
of his better half, who was perfectly astonished at
her good man’s boldness. ‘We live just below
here, under Melbraten Hatte; but we are a good
deal annoyed by one of your horses, that stables
near there. The sewage leaks through, and drops
on our table. The request we have to make is,
that you’ll be so good as to move his quarters.’
‘Besides which,’ said a Huldre, larger than the rest,
who, at this moment, came from a corner, and stood
bolt-upright by the bed-side, ‘one good turn deserves
another. You were making a coat for the lad,
just before Yule&mdash;you remember?’ At this Hans
started. ‘And you thought you should not have
enough cloth, but you had. Do you know why?
It was I who stretched out the cloth, so that you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
enough, and to spare. There was a bit left for me
too. Look here, this coat I have on was made of it!’</p>

<p>“On this, Hans said he should have no objection
to comply with their request. The conversation
then dropped, and from odd noises, a sort of
miniature snore, which Hans heard about, he perceived
that the little men in grey were dropping off
to sleep again. It would never do, however, for the
master of the house to follow their example, with
such outlandish guests in the house. So he took
care to keep his eyes well open. Before long, by
the flickering embers of the fire, he saw the tallest
gentleman take his (Hans’s) shirt, which his wife
had put out for the morrow, and begin tearing it
into shreds. ‘Hold hard there!’ exclaimed Hans,
whose wife, overcoming her fears, had jogged him,
when she saw the produce of her industry thus
impudently destroyed. ‘Hold hard! I say.’ ‘We’re
short of linen,’ answered the Huldra, soothingly,
‘and this shirt of yours will make up into a great
many shirts for us.’ ‘Hold hard!’ again screamed
Hans, whose mettle was thoroughly roused, his
spouse also being in a great state of pucker, ‘or
I’ll cock the rifle, by the rood!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whether it was his gesture to reach down the
rifle, or whether the name of Cors (Rood or Cross)
did it, Hans could not say; but they were all off in
a moment. It was quite a treat to see them bundling
out, helter-skelter, as hard as ever they could get
out,” added the ancient dame, whose upraised eyebrows,
and a twitch at the corner of her mouth,
showed that she was no foe to mirth, and enjoyed
the rapid exit of the Trolls extremely.</p>

<p>“Such lots of them,” continued she, excitedly,
as if she saw them there and then, “he could
not count them. He hurried after them to the
doorway, and got a sight of them, by the light of
the snow and the stars, mounting on their horses,
and riding away as fast as they could lay legs to
ground. On examining his shirt, he found it
was quite whole again. So no damage was done
after all. He took care, however, to move the
horse, in order to abate the nuisance complained
of, and the animal throve remarkably well in
his new quarters. But I must get your dinner
ready.”</p>

<p>And so out the old lady went, in due time returning
with some pancakes and fried siek, a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of fresh-water herring, which, with perch and trout,
abounds in the lake close by.</p>

<p>While the repast was digesting, I began to ruminate
on these stories, and the remarkable likeness,
nay, even identity, some of them exhibit to the
superstitions of that part of Great Britain where
the Northern invaders mostly frequented. Fairy
lore is traced by some authors to the Pagan superstitions
of Greece and Rome, and to the superstitions
of the East. But we prefer to regard
these supernatural beings in Scandinavia rather
as in the main of home-growth than as exotics;
the creations of a primitive people, who, living
among wonderful natural phenomena, and being
ignorant of their cause, with the proverbial boldness
and curiosity of ignorance, were fond of
deriving an origin for them of their own manufacture,
and one stamped with the impress of
their own untutored imaginations. And what a
country they live in for the purpose!<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> None fitter
could have been devised for the residence and
operations of mysterious and frightful beings.
Plod along the calm, friendly landscape of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
dotted thickly with houses and steeples, with the
church bells ringing merrily, or the station bell
clanging imperatively (bells are the <i>bête noire</i> of
Trolls), and the scene alive with people,&mdash;a chaw-bacon,
with no speculation in his eye, driving along
the heavy wain, or a matter-of-fact “commercial”
labouring along with his loaded four-wheel over
the dusty <i>strata viarum</i>,&mdash;and I’ll defy you to be
otherwise than common-place and unimaginative.
But let even a highly-educated man wander alone
through the tingling silentness of the mighty pine-woods
of the North, broken at one time by the
rumble of an earthslip, at another by the roar of a
waterfall, seething in some weird chasm. Let him
roam over the grey fjeld, and see through the morning
mist a vast head bent threateningly over him,
and, unless he be a very Quaker, his imagination
will turn artist or conjuror, and people the landscape
with the half-hidden forms of beings more
or less than human. And so it was with the
old heathen Norskman, living all alone in the
wilderness. When he heard the tempest howl
through the ravine, and saw the whirlwind crumple
up the trees, it must be the spirits of Asgaard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sweeping by with irresistible force. If in autumn
evenings strange gabblings were heard aloft,
caused by the birds of passage moving southward,
it must be troll-wives on their airy ride. If lights
were seen on the stream at night, they were “corpse
lights,” though in reality only caused by some
fellow burning the water for salmon. If the ice
split with sudden and fearful sound, engulphing
the hopeless wayfarer, it was an evil spirit, requiring
a human sacrifice. Those pot-looking
holes and finger-marks in the rocks&mdash;those mysterious
foot-marks, whence were they? Those
strange, grotesque figures, as like as they can be
to human forms and faces&mdash;they must once have
been evil beings or demons, now turned to stone
by some superior power&mdash;a power that at one time
revealed itself in the hissing race aloft of the
Borealis; at another time blasted and shivered the
rocks in thunder and lightning. The sea naturally
would be a special locality for these sprites. Did
not they often see phantom-ships, which a modern
would explain by the natural phenomenon of the
mirage? Did not sea-monsters from time to time
show themselves to the lone fisherman? Did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
they often see strange sights at the bottom of the
transparent deep? Did not the calm surface suddenly
rise into ruffian, crested billows, while
dismal shrieks would echo at the same time from
the rock-piercing caverns?</p>

<p>But other causes were at work. The more ancient
inhabitants of Scandinavia, some of them of giant
size and prodigious strength, others small of stature
but very agile, like the Fins or Laps, were driven
into the mountains by Odin and his Asiatics. From
these hiding-places they would at times emerge&mdash;the
former to do deeds of ferocity and violence,
the latter to practise some of their well-known
tricks, such as thieving, changing children, kidnapping
people away with them. And this would,
in process of time, give rise to the fancy of the
existence of supernatural beings, gigantic Jotuls
and tiny Trolls (in the Edda Finnr is the name for
dwarfs), endued with peculiar powers. In the
same way the vulgar Scotch ascribed superhuman
attributes to the Picts, or Pechts.</p>

<p>Adam of Bremen, in the eleventh century, says
that Sweyne Estridson, King of Denmark, told
him that in Sweden people used to come from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
hills and do great damage, and then disappear.
The same author relates that in Norway there were
wild women and men, who lived in the woods, and
were something between men and beasts. The
existence of these creatures, by whatever name
called, being once assumed, all sorts of explanations
were given of their origin. Thus, there is an odd
Swedish superstition, that when God hurled down
Lucifer and his host from heaven, they did not all
fall into the burning lake, but that some fell into
the sea, others upon the earth, and became the
various spirits proper to those places. Another not
less quaint Danish legend is to this effect:&mdash;When
Eve was washing her bairns one day in a spring,
the Almighty suddenly called to her. Alarmed, she
threw those of her bairns that she had not washed
aside, when God asked her whether all her children
were there. She replied, “Yes.” Whereupon he
said, “What thou hast tried to hide from God shall
be hidden from men.” In a moment the unwashed
children were separated from the others, and disappeared.
Before the flood, God put them all into a
hole, the entrance of which he fastened. From them
all the underground people spring. Others again, say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that they descend from Adam, by his first wife, Lileth,
while others pronounce them to be a mixed race of
the sons of God and daughters of men. Even Hermann
Ruge, the pastor of Slidre, in Norway, in 1754,
gravely talked of underground people who were something
between men and beasts. While that strange
compound of superstition and enthusiasm, Luther
himself, speaks of changelings as a matter of course.</p>

<p>But it is time to think of another sort of changeling,
I mean the fresh horse, which, after a long
delay, has arrived at the door. “Good bye, Mrs.
Anna, many thanks.”</p>

<p>“Farvel, farvel! if you meet with Tidemann on
your travels, say Anna Gulsvig sends him her
greeting. Bless you, sir, we knew him well; he
was at my son’s wedding, and pictured us all.”</p>

<p>She was alluding to the celebrated painter of
that name, who resides in Düsseldorf, but visits
his native country, Norway, every summer, returning
home rich with pictorial spoils, gained in scenes
like these. Professor Gude, the eminent painter,
also of Düsseldorf, is the son of a gentleman who
held a government office in this neighbourhood.</p>

</div>

<p>Driving through the woods on the shores of the
lake, after a good deal of up and down hill, I at
length arrived at the ferry, twenty miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Gulsvig, where the Krorenfjord contracts into a
river. Green, the station for the night, affords
excellent accommodation; so much so, that the
notorious Danish Count (See <i>Oxonian in Norway</i>),
so addicted to bear-hunting, has been up as far as
here on purpose to taste the port-wine. By-the-bye,
I encountered a Norsk proverb to-day, which
if it were not ancient, would almost seem to have
been made for the Count: “Han har skut Björn,”
literally, “he has shot a bear,” is said of a man
who is drunk. People in that state not only see
double, but shoot with the longbow.</p>

<p>Gunild Green was the perfection of a landlady,
putting meat and good bread before the wayfarer,
and beer of the best. Her blue jacket, with its
odd gussets behind, and broad edging of red and
yellow braid, did not, it is true, reach nearly down
to the place where a woman’s waist ought to be.
But that was no matter, for the skirt made up for
the omission by advancing to the jacket. Her
Quaker-like, quiet face was framed in a neat cap,
and the forehead bound in with a silk kerchief.
All about the house betokened considerable wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>But notwithstanding that these people are of the
Upper Ten Thousand of Norway, I hear that the
old superstitious customs still obtain at the gaard.
A cross in chalk, or an axe or a toll-knife is placed
over every cattle-shed at Yule. The old lady gave
no reason further than it was skik (custom). A
cake with a cross of juniper berries made on the
top of it is baked at Christmas against Candlemas-day
(Kyndel-misse). In other parts of Norway a
small cake is baked for each person, and not eaten
till twenty days after. Again, the sledges are never
allowed at Christmas to lie flat on the ground, but
are reared up against the wall. If anybody goes
thrice round the house, then looks in at a window
through a black kerchief and sees anyone at the board
without a head, that person will die before next Yule.</p>

<p>The day after Yule the men go out with the
cow-house ordure very early, before light. They
never, if they can help it, bring in water for the
copper on Yule, but get a supply into the house the
day before. On Christmas Eve every person of condition
has a mess of rice-porridge, and the servants
in better class houses come into the room and
receive a glass of something comfortable. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
cattle are not overlooked on this great Christian
festival. “Come, Dokkero,” says the milkmaid, just
like some girl in Theocritus, to her cow, “you shall
have some good food to-day.”</p>

<p>Finding that I can go some five miles by water,
I select that method of conveyance. Indeed, I
should prefer this species of locomotion for the rest
of the journey, for I find, on examination, that in
consequence of the jolting motion of the country
carts, my effects are pounded up as if they had been
brayed in a mortar. One or two silk kerchiefs have
turned into tatters, and the sand of the cartridges
has oozed out and become mixed up with the contents
of the broken Macassar oil bottle, which I had
destined for my elf-locks on again reaching civilization.
The boat was long and narrow, and easily
rowed, but the stalwart rower was hardly a match
in speed for some little black and white ducks to
which we gave chase. At last we got among them.
Down they dived, and, as they reappeared, off went
my gun; but in consequence of the crankness of
the boat, it was impossible to take aim quick enough,
and, after a few unavailing shots, I gave up the
game, fairly beaten. My fishing tackle likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
did no execution among the trout, which now begin
to get smaller. The boatman mentioned two other
kinds of fish to be found here, “scad” and “jup.”</p>

<p>In fact we are now getting out of the wild
sporting of the upper valleys, although six rifles
suspended in the passage of the next station-house,
Vassenrud, betokened the existence of large fowl,
and probably beasts of prey, in the forests around.
Countless logs float down this river, and I see here
a list of the different brands used by the Drammen
merchants to distinguish the several owners.</p>

<p>As the horse I was to have lived across the
Sound, I had ample time to look about me, and
observe the peculiarities of the establishment.
The best room floor was painted in figures, around
it were ranged a score of high-backed, old-fashioned
leather chairs, stamped with a pattern. I wish the
author of the Sketch-book could have seen them;
he would have made them all tell a history at once.
Leaving this room, I followed my nose, and entered
the door facing. A very fat man, with a heavy,
sleepy eye, quite a tun of a fellow, a red skull-cap
striped with black on his head, sat in his
shirt sleeves eating a leg of veal, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
flanked by some nice-looking bread and a bottle
of brandy. It was only nine, <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, but the opportunity
was not to be lost, so I fell to also.
Beside me, on a shelf, was a tankard of massive
silver, weighing one hundred and twenty lod =
about sixty-five ounces English. Pretty well to do,
thought I, these peaceful descendants of the Vikings.</p>

<p>In reply to my query whether there were any old
memorials about, the obese Boniface moved his
lack-lustre eye slowly, and shook his head. Old
memorials, forsooth! were not the newly-killed calf
and its appetizing adjuncts subjects much more
worthy of attention? Presently, however, after an
interval of seemingly profound thought, he observed
that there was something like a coffin or two in the
forest a mile off.</p>

<p>“Had they been opened?”</p>

<p>“No. People thought it unlucky to touch
them. They were near his hûsman’s, and the hûsman
would show me them if I mentioned his name.”</p>

<p>At the hûsman’s I found nobody but his wife,
who was ignorant on the subject. So, after a
fatiguing search, I returned without having accomplished
my purpose, and the horse having arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
I had to start. The fat man was now recumbent
on the bed within, looking uncommonly like a
barrel of beer. All Norwegians take a siesta at
noon. The charge made for my sumptuous repast
was twelve skillings = five-pence English. As we
roll along gaily through the sombre pine-forests,
the odour of which the Norwegians, I think
wrongly, compare to that of a “dead house”
(Liighus). I fall, as a matter of course, into conversation
with Knut, my schuss.</p>

<p>“Had he ever seen these trolls which people
talked of so much higher up the valley.”</p>

<p>“No; I never <i>saw</i> one; but I’ve <i>heard</i> one.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, where?”</p>

<p>“When I was hewing wood in the forest.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He only said ‘Knut’ three times.”</p>

<p>“And did you speak?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;that would have been unlucky. They
are not such bad people, folks say, if you only
become well acquainted with them.”</p>

<p>In the forest we passed some splendid trees near
Snarum. “Valuable timber about here,” I observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, very. It’s not long ago that some sold for
a hundred dollars apiece (twenty pound sterling);
they were seventy feet long, and more than four in
diameter. Vassenrud (the fat station-master, no
wonder, with all this property, he is fat) has a deal
of forest. He sold some lately. He got sixteen
thousand dollars for giving leave to fell the timber
on a square mile (seven English), none to be cut
smaller than nine inches in diameter, eighteen feet
from the ground. These trees just here belong
to a stingy old fellow, who lives down there by
the side of the river, Ole Ulen. A man came from
the By (town) to see them, and make a purchase.</p>

<p>“‘I have come to look at the trees,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ said Ole Ulen; ‘we’ll go and see
them.’</p>

<p>“Arrived in the forest, the stranger measured
the big trees with his eye, and thought they would
suit exactly.</p>

<p>“‘Fine trees, aren’t they?’ said Ole Ulen, adjusting
his spectacles, and almost breaking his neck to
look up at the trees. ‘So tall and so thick,’ he
continued, like a miser gloating over his treasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Not bad,’ replied the proposing buyer, in a
careless tone, chuckling inwardly at the thought of
the bargain he was going to drive with the plainly-dressed,
simple-looking old bonder, but careful not
to betray his admiration of the magnificent timber,
for fear of sending up the prices.</p>

<p>“‘No, not so bad,’ said Ole Ulen, as they walked
homeward.</p>

<p>“‘Well, what’s to be the price?’ asked the merchant,
while they were drinking a glass of brandy.</p>

<p>“‘Price!’ replied the other; ‘I’m not going to
sell them&mdash;never thought of it. You asked to look
at them, and so you have, and welcome, and well
worth seeing they are.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, no doubt,’ said Knut; ‘he might do what
he liked with his own trees. Sell them or not, as
he thought proper.’</p>

<p>“‘But he’s so fond of his money, he won’t help
his own kith and kin. There was his son-in-law,
over the river, had just completed a purchase, and
went to him to borrow three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“‘Very sorry,’ was his reply, ‘but he had got no
cash in the house.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“The young man went and got accommodated
at another farm, and then returned to Ule’s.</p>

<p>“‘Well, how have you fared?’</p>

<p>“‘All right; I got the loan. They were the
more willing to lend, for they had some notes of
old date, which are to be called in by the bank at
Trondjem, before the month’s out, and it will save
them the trouble and expense of sending them up
there.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, so,’ replied Ule, meditatively. ‘What is
the date of the notes that are to be called in?
Perhaps I may have some.’ And going to an old
cupboard, he produced from a coffee-pot seven
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>We now get into an enclosed and more cultivated
country, and see symptoms of civilization as
we approached Vikersund, in the shape of a drunken
man or two staggering homewards; and, at the
merchant’s, where I stop to make some small purchase,
there is a crowd of peasants clustering round
the counter, or sitting in corners, imbibing corn
brantviin.</p>

<p>At Vikersund the road forks. That to the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
leads to Christiania, by the shores of the beautiful
Tyri Fjord and the pass of Krog-Kleven; the
other crossing the wide sound, the only vent of the
Tyri, Hols, and Rand fjords, by a very long bridge,
goes to Drammen and Kongsberg.</p>

<p>In the stream lie thousands of logs that have
been cut down in the mountains and along the
feeders of this glorious waterway, to the very foot
of the Fillefjeld. Some of them have, perhaps, left
their native grove two or three years ago, and
would never have got here were it not for certain
persons jogging their memories and goading them
into unwilling activity. One of the most characteristic
features of a Norwegian valley are gangs of
burly broad-chested men, armed with huge poles,
the ends of which are shod with a hook and spike.
Directly there are symptoms of the water rising
after rain, these fellows appear suddenly, and are
seen pushing the stranded timbers from the shore,
dashing through the water in their great jack-boots,
to islands or shoals, for the like purpose, or boating
across the river to set afloat some straggling laggard;
and, forthwith, all these, like so many great cadises,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
just disengaged from their anchor, and soon to
take wing, go swarming down the stream. The
boat, by-the-bye, used by these Norsk equivalents
to the Far West lumber-men, is never destined to
return to its mountain home, but will be sold
below for what it will fetch.</p>

<p>In Norway scenes are constantly meeting the
traveller’s eye, whether it be such as that just
described, or the rude log-huts, or the countless
tree stumps, the work of the axe, or the unthinned
density of forests which are not near any watercourse,
which forcibly bring to one’s mind Oliphant’s
description of Minnesota and the Far
West. But there is this trifling difference, that
whereas there you may as likely as not be bulleted,
or your weasand slit by a bowie-knife, you are
safer in this country than in any land in Europe.</p>

<p>As it was my purpose to visit a clergyman in
the neighbourhood, I left the main route, and took
a short cut, by which I saved six miles in distance,
though not in time. For the short way was a
pleasant alternation of ledges of rock and mudpits.
Fortunately I was provided with an air-cushion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to sit upon, or the jolting must have
proved fatal, at all events to my teeth. If there
is no dentist here&mdash;such a thing I never heard of
in Norway&mdash;there ought to be.</p>

<p>After four or five miles up and down, we descended
in good earnest through a straggling
grove of pines, their dark foliage now rendered
darker by the fast approaching night. To our left
I could see something white, and heard fierce
roarings. The broad expanse of water at Vikersund
had narrowed into a mere fissure, only a few yards
across, with splintered walls of overhanging rock.
What! that small-throated boa-constrictor going to
swallow up such a monstrous lump of water at a
mouthful? Choked it will be, and no mistake.
See, what a chattering, and frothing, and smoking!
That lot of trees, too, they must stick in his
gizzard; half-a-dozen have lodged there already,
firm and immovable, as if riveted by the strongest
bolts. A few steps more, and behold! the strife
has ceased; the logs, together with the boiling
soapsuds, have shot through the tunnel or funnel,
and lie heaving and panting on the waters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
another river of no little breadth and volume, which,
swiftly gliding through the forest, cuts in here, and
joins the narrow outlet of the great Drammen
river at right angles.</p>

<p>After their prodigious tussle, it must be quite a
relief to those much battered logs to rock in the
comparatively tranquil lap of the Hallingdal river;
for it is my old friend of Hemse-Fjeld reminiscence&mdash;who
kept now rollicking and roaring like a
schoolboy, now floating lightly and whispering
softly, like a miss in her teens, as we journeyed
along together&mdash;that here clubs its fortunes with
the lusty progeny of the Fillefjeld.</p>

<p>At the fork made by the two streams dwelt a
ferryman, who speedily transferred my effects from
the carriole to his frail boat. It required careful
navigation to get over; as the surge of the
Vikersund river&mdash;which, as the ferryman told me,
albeit it had come through such an eye of a needle,
was by far the bigger of the two&mdash;was of such
momentum and so sudden in its dash that the
crowding waters of the Halling were struck all of a
heap by the concussion, and fairly turned round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and fled. After recovering the first shock, however,
it gradually established a nearer intimacy with the
boisterous stranger, and they presently made a
fresh start forward, and vaulted together over a
rugged rapid below, which I could just see gleaming
through the dusky shades of the evening, and
the forest. The first struggles with the world of
the new-married couple.</p>

<p>“We have only to get up the hill,” said the
ferryman, shouldering my pack, as we safely reached
the opposite shore, “and we shall be soon at the
parson’s house.”</p>

<p>A warm welcome did I get from my friend the
pastor. He recognised my voice directly, as he
opened the door in the dark.</p>

<p>“Vilkommen, Vilkommen, Metcalfe! Hvor staae
til? (welcome, Metcalfe! how are you?) Det
fornoie mig meget, at de har ikke glemt os (I’m
glad you’ve not forgotten us).”</p>

<p>And I was speedily in the Stuë, shaking hands
with the Fruë (clergymen’s wives have by law this
title; merchants’ wives are only madame). Her
fair, good-humoured face fatter, and her figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
rounder than when I saw her four years ago at the
mountain parish in the west. Lisa, too, the hobbledehoy
girl, all legs and arms, like a giblet pie,
has now become quite a woman, and more retiring.
The baby, Arilda, too, runs about bigger and
bonnier, while Katinka, another and elder sister,
whom I have never seen before, comes forward to
greet her father’s friend. There are also some
ladies from the “by” (town), with the latest news,
foreign and domestic.</p>

<p>I spend a day or two with my kind and intelligent
host and his family. Much of his income is
derived from land, so that he farms on a large
scale. The house is beautifully situate. Beneath
us may be seen the river playing at hide and seek
among umbrageous woods. On the hills opposite
is the mother church of the district, with large
farms clustering about it. The neighbourhood
abounds in minerals. Not far off is a cobalt-work,
now under the auspices of a Saxon company,
and which is said to be productive. If
the old derivation for cobold be from cobalt,
because that particular sort of sprite’s favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
<i>habitat</i> is a mine of this description, I shall, no
doubt, pick up a goblin story or two at the
manse.</p>

<p>Katinka, the eldest girl, is very well read; better
certainly than any I have met with in the country,
for they are not a reading people. She sings a
national song or two with much feeling, and explains
to me the meaning of them, which, as they
are written in old Norsk, would be otherwise
difficult of comprehension.</p>

<p>“But how do you know the meaning of this outlandish
lingo?&mdash;it’s not a bit like the written
Norsk of the present time.”</p>

<p>“It was not for nothing,” replied she, “that I
lived from a baby in the mountain parish where we
first saw you. The inhabitants of those sequestered
dales still use many of the old words and forms
of speech.”</p>

<p>I was soon on my hobby&mdash;legends and superstitions.</p>

<p>“Have you any witches or spæ-wives, as they
are called in Scotland?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Signe-kierringe, you mean. Oh, yes. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
are still to be found. My aunt there, when she
was a girl, was measured by one.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“They take a string, which they pretend has
been prepared in some wonderful manner, and measure
round the waist, and along the arms, and so
on most accurately, and there is supposed to be
some wonderful virtue in the operation. It is a
sure recipe against all harm from the Nisser. But
I have a book here, with a tale of one Mads, a warlock.
He was cutting timber in the forest; it was
about mid-day. He had just got the wedge into a
fallen tree, when he saw his old woman come up
with his dinner. It was romme-gröd (a peculiar
sort of porridge). She sat down, when he just
spied a tail peeping out behind her, which she
chanced to stick in the cleft that he had made in
the tree. Mads bade her wait a bit, and he would
sit down and eat directly. The cunning fellow
meantime managed to get the wedge out. The
crack closed, and the tail was fast. At the same
time he uttered Jesus’ name. Up started the hag,
and snapped off the end of her tail. What a scream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
she gave. On looking at the dinner, he found it
was nothing but some cow-dung in a bark basket.”</p>

<p>“Have not the peasantry here,” I inquired,
“some odd notions about the fairies stopping the
wheel of the water-mill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” replied Miss Katinka. “September
1st is an important day for the millers. If it is
dry on that day it will be dry, they say, for a long
time. This is owing to the Quernknurre (mill
sprite).</p>

<p>“There is a tale in Asbjörnsen of a miller near
Sandok Foss, in Thelemarken (I visited this place
afterwards), whose mill-wheel would not go, although
there was plenty of water. He examined the
machinery accurately, but could not discover what
was amiss. At last he went to the small door that
opened into the wheel-box. Opening it a very
little he spied a most vicious-looking troll poking
about inside. Closing the door with all speed,
before the troll caught sight of him, he went to his
hut and put on the fire a large pot full of tar.
When it was boiling hot he went to the wheel door
and opened it wide. The troll inside, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
busy scotching the wheel, faced round at him in a
moment, and opened his mouth (or rather his head)
wider than a warming pan, indeed so wide that his
gape actually reached from the door sill to the top
of the door. ‘Did you ever see such a gape as
that in all your life?’ said he to the miller. Without
a moment’s delay the miller poured the hot
pitch right into the monster’s throat (which might
be called pitching it into him), and answered the
inquiry by asking another, ‘Did you ever get such
a hot drink before?’ It would appear that the
miller had effectually settled the creature, for he
sunk down into the water with a fearful yell, and
never was heard of more. From that day forward
the miller throve, and much grist came to him,
actually and figuratively.”</p>

<p>Miss Katinka was not a classical scholar, so I
suppressed certain illustrations which rose to my
tongue, as she told the story, such as “hians
immane,” and the miller having used a most
effectual digamma for stopping the hiatus; and
I told her instead, that in the Scottish highlands
there is a kindred being called Urisk, a hairy sprite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
who sets mills at work in the night when there is
nothing to grind, and that he was once sent howling
away by a pan full of hot ashes thrown into his
lap when asleep.</p>

<p>“I have read another curious story of a mill,”
continued my fair informant.</p>

<p>“There was a peasant up in the west whose
mill (quern) was burned down two Whitsuntides
following. The third year, on Whitsun Eve, a
travelling tailor was staying with him, making
some new clothes for the next day. ‘I wonder
whether my new mill will be burnt down to-night
again?’ said the peasant. ‘Oh, I’ll keep watch,’
exclaimed the tailor; ‘no harm shall happen.’
True to his word, when night came on, the knight
of the shears betook himself to the mill. The first
thing he did was to draw a large circle with his
chalk on the floor, and write ‘Our Father’ round it,
and, that done, he was not afraid, no not even if
the fiend himself were to make his appearance. At
midnight the door was suddenly flung open, and a
crowd of black cats came in. The tailor watched.
Before long the new comers lit a fire in the chimney-corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and got a pot upon it, which soon began to
bubble and squeak, as if it was full of boiling pitch.
Just then, one of the cats slily put its paw on the
side of the pot, and tried to upset it. ‘Mind, nasty
cat, you’ll burn yourself,’ said the tailor, inside his
ring. ‘Mind, nasty cat, you’ll burn yourself, says
the tailor to me,’ says the cat to the other cats.
And then all the cats began dancing round the
ring. While they were dancing, the same cat
stole slily to the chimney-corner and was on the
point of upsetting the pot, when the tailor exclaimed,
‘Mind, nasty cat, you’ll burn yourself.’
‘Mind, nasty cat, you’ll burn yourself, says the
tailor to me,’ says the cat to the other cats. And
then the whiskered crew began to dance again round
the tailor. Another attempt at arson was made
with no better success. And all the cats danced
round the tailor, quicker and quicker, their eyes
glowing, till his head spun round again. But still
he luckily kept his self-possession and his sense.
At last the cat, which had tried to upset the pot,
made a grab at him over the ring, but missed. The
tailor was on the alert, and next time the cat’s paw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
came near he snipped it off short with his shears.
What a spitting and miauling they did make, as
they all fled out of the mill, leaving the tailor to
sleep quietly in his ring for the rest of the night.
In the morning he opened the mill door and went
down to the peasant’s house. He and his wife were
still in bed, for it was Whitsun morning, and they
were having a good sleep of it. How glad the
miller was to see the tailor. ‘Good morrow to
you,’ he said, reaching out his hand, and giving
the tailor a hearty greeting. ‘Good morrow,
mother,’ said the tailor to the wife, offering her
his hand. But she looked so strange and so pale,
he could not make it out. At last she gave him
her left hand, and kept the other under the sheepskin.
Ay, ay, thought the tailor, I see how the
ground lies.”</p>

<p>“The miller-wife was one of the subterranean
people, then,” I put in.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” said Miss Katinka.</p>

<p>“If the tailor had been an Englishman,” observed
I, “we should have said that he ‘knew which way
the cat jumped;’” and then I had to explain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
this elicited the remark, that the Norwegians are
by no means deficient in proverbs.</p>

<p>“Have you a Norwegian equivalent to our commonest
of English proverbs&mdash;‘to carry coals to
Newcastle?’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in the worthy pastor, “but with a
difference. We say, ‘to carry the bucket over the
brook to fetch water.’”</p>

<p>“Well, we have another, not less common&mdash;‘to
reckon upon your chickens before they are
hatched.’”</p>

<p>“That’s our ‘you must not sell the skin till
you’ve shot the bear.’ It’s just the same as yours,
but with a local colouring.”</p>

<p>“All these proverbs, by the way, are not true,”
continued I. “There is an English proverb that it
requires nine tailors to make a man: as if a tailor
was inferior to the rest of mankind in courage.
That last story of Miss Katinka’s is a proof to the
contrary. I remember being in Berlin, just after
the revolution of 1848, and visiting the cemetery of
those who had fallen. There was one monument
to the memory of one Johann Schwarz, with an inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to the effect that he fought like a hero,
and received nine, or maybe nineteen wounds.
Indeed, at the London police-offices, whenever a
man is brought before his Worship for assault and
battery of the worst description, or for drubbing the
policemen within an inch of their lives, the odds
are that it will be a tailor with a little body and a
great soul.”</p>

<p>But my last observations were quite lost on my
fair informant. For at this moment a letter was
put into her hands, and she escaped from the room,
her colour rising, and her thoughtful eye assuming
a softer and more conscious expression.</p>

<p>“It’s Katinka’s weekly letter from her betrothed,”
explained her father, when she had gone; “they
always correspond once a week, and this is the day
when the post arrives.”</p>

<p>As I was walking about the house, in company
with my clerical friend, I had a fresh proof of the facilities
afforded in this country to clever artisans to improve
themselves. Thus, one Ole, who is driving the
hay-cart up the steep inclined plane to the hay-loft,
over the cow-house, has shown a strong turn for
mechanics, and on the clergyman’s recommendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
has obtained from the government three hundred
dollars to defray the expense of a journey to England,
that he may be further initiated and perfected
in the mysteries of his trade. Another man about
the farm, who has exhibited much natural talent as
an engraver, is going to be sent to Christiania, to
a craftsman in that line.</p>

<p>Among other things, I hear from my host of a
regulation, in respect to ecclesiastical matters, which
is well worth mentioning. In England, as we all
know, no provision is made by the law for pensioning
off a superannuated clergyman, or for the support
of a clergyman’s widow; nay, the very sensible
proposal to pension a bishop, the other day, was
decried as simony. Not so in Norway. The
widow of a beneficed clergyman here has a proportion
of the income of the benefice (from twenty to
sixty dollars) during her life. Besides this, there
is attached to most parishes what is called an Enkesæde
(widow farm). Formerly she cultivated this
herself; but, by a late regulation, these places have
been sold, and she has the profits, which vary, in
different cases, in amount.</p>

<p>Besides the beneficed clergy, there are in Norway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
another class of clergy called Residerende Capellan.
He holds a chapel of ease in some large parish,
with land and house attached, but is quite independent
of the rector. His appointment, like that of
the beneficed clergy generally, is vested in the king.
On a vacancy, the applications are received by the
government, and sent to the king, marked 1, 2, 3,
in order of merit. He generally chooses the first,
but not always. The number of these chaplains is
small&mdash;not above ten in all Norway. In some respects,
the Residerende Capellan has less work than
the Sogne Prest, or rector. Thus the Fattig-wesen,
or arrangement for the relief of the poor, is chiefly
managed by the Sogne Prest.</p>

<p>The Personal Capellan corresponds to an English
curate. Whenever a rector requires a curate, he is
bound to take one who is out of employment; and
he cannot get rid of him, but must retain his services
as long as he is rector. His successor in
the living, however, is not similarly bound. It is
conceivable that the rector and curate may have
differences, and that this perpetuity of connexion
may in some instances become irksome to both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Generally, however, it is found to work well&mdash;they
make the best of it, like a sensible man and wife.
And the curate is not exposed, as he sometimes is
in England, to the caprices of a rector, or a gynæcocratical
rectoress. Nor, again, is the public eye
offended in this country with those unpleasant
advertisements of curates holding the views of
Venn, with strong lungs, or of Anglicans skilful in
intoning and church decoration.</p>

<p>“What examinations have you at the University
of Christiania?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There are three. First, the Philosophisk, <i>i.e.</i>,
a mixed classical examination; second, one in
mathematics, physics, theology, and other subjects;
and, three years later, there is what is called an
Embeds examen (faculty examination), which, for
the future clergyman, is in divinity; for the lawyer,
in law; and so on. After this examination, however,
a clergyman is not compelled to be ordained
directly&mdash;indeed, he can put this off for some years.”</p>

<p>“And are the Norwegian students such ardent
spirits as their brethren in Germany?”</p>

<p>“Ardent enough, but blessed, I hope, with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
common sense. They are intense lovers of liberty,
and their minds are full of the idea of Scandinavian
unity&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a junction not only moral, but political,
of the three kingdoms, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
It was only the other day that a thousand Norwegian
students paid a visit to Upsala and Stockholm,
and then went over to Copenhagen. They
were received with open arms by the Danes. The
shopkeepers would have no money for the articles
they disposed of to them, begging them to take
what they had asked for as a <i>souvenir</i> of Denmark.
They lived in private houses, and partook of the
best during their stay, entirely gratuitously; the
King himself bore his share of the Leitourgia, lodging
and boarding them in the palace. This Scandinavian
party is gaining ground. It would be a
great thing for Norway if the Bernadotte dynasty
could succeed to the throne of the three kingdoms.
They are of a much better stock than the descendants
of Christian the First. Look at Oscar and his
eldest son, the free-hearted, outspoken soldier; and
then look at the throne of Denmark&mdash;a king who
first marries a respectable princess and divorces her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
for another, and does the same by her for no reason
but because he has set eyes on a sempstress at a
fire one night in the capital, and is determined to be
possessed of her&mdash;and there she is, the Countess
Danner. But he is blessed with no offspring, and
when he dies the Danes get a Russian for their
king, or what’s next to it. No wonder, then, that
the Scandinavian idea finds favour in Denmark.
Even the king favours the idea; his toast, ‘Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway&mdash;three lands in peace,
one in war,’ shows that, selfish as he is, and careless
of trampling on the feelings of those he has
sworn to love and cherish, he has some little regard
for the future of his people, and has not so far forgotten
Waldemar and Knut, as to wish Denmark
to be a mere appanage of Russia&mdash;in short, he has
always aimed at being a popular monarch.”</p>

<p>“A grand idea,” said I, “no doubt, this of Scandinavian
unity. I hear that Worsaae, and many of
the Danish professors, have taken it up. But I
don’t think professors, generally, are practical men&mdash;at
least, not in Germany, judging from what
they did in Frankfort in 1848. They were with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
child for many months, big with an ineffable conception,
but they only brought forth wind after all.”</p>

<p>“Ay! but we Norwegians don’t manage in that
way. Look at Eideswold, in 1814, and say whether
we are not practical men.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think Norway has anything to
fear from the jealousy of Sweden?” I went on,
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“No. There have been two or three times when
we have been in a klem (hitch); but the good,
sturdy common sense, and quiet resolution of us
Norwegians has won the day. And now I think
of it, this appointment of the Crown Prince to be
viceroy at Christiania will be of inestimable benefit
to the country. Our future ruler will get to
understand the people, and know their worth. He
will see what our freedom is doing for us. He makes
himself quite at home with all, gentle and simple:
dances with the parsons’ wives and daughters, and
smokes cigars with the merchants, but he is observing
all the while very narrowly; and he sees we are all
united in our attachment to our liberal institutions,
and thriving under them wonderfully; while, at the
same time, all are most loyal to the kingly house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“But don’t you think these religious schisms,
Lammers on the one hand and the Roman Catholics
on the other, will be causing a split in your
national unity?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no. It is true the Roman Catholics
have a great cathedral at Christiania; but they
don’t number more than a couple of hundred in
all.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but there are some more in the North.
It was only the other day I heard that some
Papists are engaged in an active propaganda
about Tromsö.”</p>

<p>“No doubt; the people up there have always
been peculiarly inclined to be carried about by
every wind of doctrine. It is there that the
Haugianer made way; and it is there that these
Papists have pitched their tents. They are going
to work very systematically. They have purchased
an estate at Alten. Every Sunday they preach to
whoever will come. One of their addresses begins
with the following attractive exordium:&mdash;‘Beloved
brethren, we have left father and mother, brothers
and sisters, fatherland and friends, from affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to you.’ Again, they boldly talk of bringing into
the country light for semi-darkness. The poor Laps
much want some little book to be distributed gratis
to explain to them the subtilty of these people.
I wish you could make the case known to the
excellent English Bible Society. And whereas
the Haugians were always reputed to be cold
and indifferent to the poor, these missionaries are
very kind to them, visiting the sick, and offering
food, clothing, and instruction gratis. The
whole plan is most subtly contrived, especially
when the fanatic character of the Laps, and
their poverty is considered. If the Government
does not take care, and see after their
spiritual and temporal wants, they may fall, I
grant, into the hands of those people. But I don’t
think the Norwegians will ever listen to them.
There is an independence in our character that
rebels against all priestly domination.”</p>

<p>“So there is in England. But even there
it is astonishing to see how far matters
are going. Why! it is only the other day
that a petition to our Queen, to restore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
‘Greater Excommunication,’ was put into my
hands to sign.”</p>

<p>But our conversation now turned from the
vanities and vagaries of man to another topic.</p>

<p>The woods around are not deficient, I find,
in capercailzie and black cock. Woodcocks,
also, from the priest’s description, must be
here at times. It was a brown bird, he said,
larger than a snipe, which at dusk flies backwards
and forwards through an alley in the
wood.</p>

<p>“That is the Linnæa borealis,” said my host
to me, pointing to a beautiful little white flower.
“A strange thing happened to me,” he said,
“when I was at my mountain parsonage in the
West. One Baron von Dübner, a Swedish
botanist, drove up one day to my house. I
found that he had journeyed all the way thither to
make inquiries about a peculiar plant which grows,
he said, just under the Iisbrae, on a particular spot
of the Dovre Fjeld, and produces berries something
like a strawberry, which ripen at the time
when the snow melts in spring. I made particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
inquiries, and at last found a lad who said he
knew what the stranger meant. He had seen and
eaten these berries while tending cattle on that
particular part of the Fjeld. I gave him a bottle,
and he promised next spring to get me some; the
baron promising to give a handsome reward. But
alas! poor Eric did not survive to fulfil his
promise. He was drowned that winter by falling
through the ice. Now, do ask your botanists at
Oxford about it.”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of my departure, I find the Norsk
flag hoisted on a tall flagstaff, on the eminence in
front of the house.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this, Miss Lisa?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s for papa’s birthday,” said she, in
high glee.</p>

<p>“I wish you many happy returns of the day,” was
my greeting to the pastor, who was evidently not a
little pleased at receiving the compliment in English.</p>

<p>Each of the ladies had something pretty to say to
him on the occasion, and the Fruë produced a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
handsome new meerschaum pipe mounted with silver,
which, by some magic process, she had obtained from
the distant By against this auspicious morning.</p>

<p>As we are off the high road, there is no change-house
near; but, by my host’s assistance, I have procured
the services of an excellent fellow, who agrees
to take me with his own horse in my friend’s carriole
all the way to Kongsberg, twenty miles off, where
I am to visit the silver mines, and return by the
same conveyance to Hougesund, on my way to
Drammen. How very kind these people are.</p>

<p>Seeing I took an interest in legends, the two
elder sisters had routed out some tracts on the
subject, and the little Arilda presented me with
some Norwegian views, and a piece of ore from
the neighbouring mine. Miss Lisa blushed and
smiled, and did not know what to make of it, when
I wickedly proposed that she should come with me
to Oxford.</p>

<p>“No,” said mamma, “if you were twenty years
older, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“And I hope, when next you visit us,” said the
priest, “you’ll be married, and bring Mrs. M.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Married! you know what I’ve told you about
Fellowships. We are Protestant monks.”</p>

<p>“Well,” retorted his reverence, “I always say
England is a great and enlightened country; but if
you wish to see an <i>effete</i> custom clung to with
desperate tenacity, go to England.”</p>

<p>What torrents of rain poured down that day, as
we journeyed along towards Kongsberg.</p>

<p>Poor Sigur was speedily soaked through, his
wadmel coat mopping up the deluge like a sponge.
But he took the thing quite as a matter of course.
As for the horse, he went on quite swimmingly.
Being encased in lengthy Cording’s fishing boots,
a sou’-wester on my head, and a long mackintosh on
my shoulders, I was quite jubilant, and could not
help defying the storm with certain exclamations,
such as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Blow winds, and crack your cheeks, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sigur, astonished at my spouting, asked for an
explanation, and on getting it, looked anything
but an assent to my proposition.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I was sorry for Sigur. But, at
the same time, waterproofed as I was, I had a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of self-reliant and independent feeling, as the rain
pattered off my caoutchouc habiliments, pretty
much the same, I should think, as the water-fowl
tribe must have, when they are having a jolly
sousing, but keep perfectly dry withal.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “Sigur,” remembering it was
September 1, “it will be fine weather for the millers,
at all events. No Quernknurre to be feared this
autumn.” Sigur smiled curiously through the
fringe of rain-drops that bugled his hat-rim. He
was evidently astonished that the Englishman had
found out that.</p>

<p>“That elv is called Dram Elv,” said he, pointing
to the river tearing along with its fleet of logs.
“Once, that farm-house which you see yonder, a
couple of hundred feet above the river, was close
to the water’s edge, but the water burst through
some rocks below, and now it’s a river instead of a
lake. There is some old story about it,” continued
he, scratching his grizzled locks, “but I forget it
now. They say that the river takes its name from
that Gaard.”</p>

<p>At Hougesund I remarked what I had never
seen before out of the towns in Norway&mdash;an intimation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
over the merchant’s door that travellers
would find accommodation there. This will give
a very good notion of the amount of hotel competition
in this country. I had a bag of shot,
No. 5, and as all shooting was now over, Sigur
received directions to sell the same to the merchant
for what he could get. The merchant took it,
loudly protesting the while that he should never
be able to sell it again. “Our shooters,” said he,
“use the largest hagel, not such dust as this.” I
can imagine that people accustomed to shoot
game sitting, would do so.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark long before we reached Kongsberg.
There was nothing left for it but to let the
horse take his own course; but as he was unacquainted
with the road, this was pretty much that
of a vessel without a compass.</p>

<p>As good luck would have it, we overtook a traveller
in a carriole, or these lines would mayhap never
have been written. “Ye gentlemen of England, who
live at home at ease,” are perhaps not aware, that in
Norway, excepting on two or three pieces of newly-constructed
road, there is no such a thing as posts
and rails to fence the highway from danger. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and then, as in Switzerland, the edge of a sheer
precipice is supposed to be guarded by blocks of
granite, placed two or three yards apart, but ordinarily
fences are only used to keep in cattle. It
was not till the next day on returning that I became
aware what I had escaped. It is true that
there was no great depth to fall, but quite enough
to break all my bones. But I might console myself
with the thought, that I should have had an
opportunity of talking to the doctor at Kongsberg,
and obtaining from him some more information about
his brownie patient, mentioned at page 232 above.</p>

<p>The object of my detour to Kongsberg was to
have a sight of the celebrated silver mine in its
neighbourhood. I had brought an introduction to
the Director, Lammers (brother of the Dissenting
Lammers of Skien), whom I found, next morning,
deeply engaged in studying a plan of the workings.
Provided by him with a note to the Superintendent,
I put myself on my carriole, and started with
Sigur for the mine. The excellent Larsen, at
whose comfortable caravansary I put up, had indoctrinated
Sigur that it was usual for strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to take a carriage from the inn; for which, of
course, I should have had to pay pretty smartly.
But I was determined to be eccentric for once, and
did the most obvious thing&mdash;take my own vehicle
and attendant. The Lauven, the best salmon
river in the south of Norway, cuts the town in
two with a stream of great width. The old wooden
bridge, being worn out, is now being superseded
by a new one, built exactly over it; so that we
have the novel sight of two bridges one above the
other. I could not learn that the good old Northern
custom of burying a child under the new bridge,
to make it durable, has been observed. At all
events, the Kongsbergers, if they did so, kept their
own counsel about it.</p>

<p>In Germany, too, this custom prevailed. Nay,
within the last twenty years (see Grimm, “Deutsche
Mythologie”), when a new bridge was built at Halle,
the people said that a child ought to be built into it.
Thiele, also, in his “Danmark’s Folkesagn,” relates
as follows:&mdash;“A wall had to be built in Copenhagen,
but as fast as they built it up, it sank into the
swampy ground. In this dilemma, a small, innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
child was set upon a stool with a table before
it, on which were playthings and sweetmeats; and
while it was amusing itself with these, twelve
masons set to work and built a vault over it, and,
at the same time, set up the wall again to the
sound of music. Since that time the wall has
never sunk the least.”</p>

<p>Nothing noticeable caught my eye on the road,
except a Thelemarken peasant-girl, in her quaint
costume, dragging a little cow to market; but as
on our return we again encountered both of them,
it was clear that, with the dogged obstinacy of
these people, rather than bate the price, she was
marching back with the cow to her distant home
in the mountains. A roundabout ascent of nearly
four miles English brought us to the principal
mine, which, as the crow flies, can be reached by
a footpath in half that distance. The device of
a hammer and pick, set crosswise over a door, with
the German motto, “Gluckauf,” reminded me that
these mines were first worked by miners from that
country.</p>

<p>Presenting my credentials, I was ushered into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
room in the superintendent’s house, and equipped
with the toggery worn on those occasions&mdash;a dark
green blouse, a leather apron fastened by a broad
belt, and worn on the opposite side of the person
to what aprons usually are; and lastly, an uncommonly
stout black felt hat, with no brim&mdash;in shape,
I should imagine, just like those worn by the Armenian
priests. Such was the disguise which I
assumed, and very suitable it was. The apron and
blouse protected my clothes from dirt, and, if a
piece of silver ore had attempted to fall upon my
head, the hat would have acted as a helmet, and
warded it off. My guide into “the bowels of the
harmless earth” now approached, and we entered
the level&mdash;commenced in 1716 by Frederick the
Fifth&mdash;and progressed for nearly two miles along
the tramway, lighted by a flaring torch, the ashes
of which the conductor ever and anon knocked off
into a vessel of water on the route. All was still,
except that now and then a sound as of rushing
waters jarred upon the ear. I found that it was
the water pumped out of the mine by the engine,
which usually glides quietly along in its wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
channel; but in places where there was a slight
ascent, got very angry, and shot along with increased
velocity. At the end of this passage we
came upon a group of miners, cooking their porridge
for the mid-day meal. They are on duty, I
understood, twenty-four hours at a stretch, so as
to save the loss of time in getting to their work
and back again, the distance in and out being so
considerable. The men looked prematurely old,
as far as I was able to judge from the very unfavourable
light; and that, no doubt, has a great
deal to do with looks at all times. The prettiest girl
that ever joined in a Christmas revel, would be
shocked if she could see a faithful representation
of her face as it looked by the blue flickering light
of the envious snapdragon.</p>

<p>But, to speak seriously, I find that though there
is no explosive air in the mine, yet there is a closeness
in the atmosphere which is prejudicial to health.
At a comparatively early age the men become
“ödelagt”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, worn out. After a certain number
of years of service they are pensioned. Their wages
are, for one class of men, 24 skillings to 30 skillings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
per diem; for another, 30 skillings to 36 skillings;
so that the lowest is about 10<i>d.</i>, and the highest rate
about 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, English. In this mine, which is called
the Kongengrube (King’s Mine), two hundred are
employed. Where we now stood was about the
centre of the mine; above us was a perpendicular
ascent to the top of the mountain, which we had
avoided by entering the level. But we now had to
descend, perpendicularly, a series of ladders, lighted
by the dim light of a candle, which the guide, for
fear of fire, had taken instead of the torch. We
now descended fifty-five perpendicular ladders, of
unequal lengths, but averaging, I understood, five
fathoms each; so that, according to Cocker, the
“tottle” we descended was 1650 feet, though, when
we stood at the bottom of the perpendicular shaft,
we were in reality 3120 feet from the upper mouth.
Each ladder rests on a wooden stage, and the top
of it against a sort of trap-door let into a similar
stage above. This perpendicularity of the shaft
is its chief danger. Should a large piece of rock
become loosened above, there is nothing but these
wooden stages to prevent it smashing through to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the bottom of the shaft; and as no notice, such as
“Heads below&mdash;look out,” is given, not a few dreadful
accidents have taken place in consequence.
Again, from the construction of the mine, it is
peculiarly dangerous in case of fire.</p>

<p>It was only in May last that a fire broke out
suddenly in the Gotteshülfe in der Not (God’s help
in time of need) Mine, where there are eighty-eight
ladders. The fire raged with such fury that four
unfortunate men were choked before they could
escape. A fifth got out alive. The burning continued
eight days. The bodies have only just been
found, August 18th.</p>

<p>Fire, I find, is used to make new horizontal
shafts. We went into one of these side shafts to
see the operation. Arrived at the end of the
gallery, which was as symmetrical as a railway
tunnel, and very hot, our further progress was
barred by a great iron door; this being opened, I
saw a huge fire of fir poles blazing away at the far
end of a kind of oven. After the fire has thus
burned for several hours, it is suffered to go out;
and the miners, approaching with their picks, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
with very little effort chip off several inches of the
hard rock, which has become as brittle as biscuit
from the action of heat. The biscuit being cleared
away, a fresh fire is lit, and another batch baked
and removed; and so on, day by day, till the miners
come to ore.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the mine I was rewarded by the
sight of a vein of pure silver. At first it seemed
to me very like the rest of the rock, except that it
was rougher to the touch; but with a little beating,
like a dull schoolboy, it brightened up wonderfully,
and I saw before me a vein of native silver, two or
three inches in width, and descending apparently
perpendicularly. The native silver thus found, together
with the argentiferous rock, is packed up in
a covered cart, under lock and key, and driven into
Kongsberg, where the smelting works are situate.</p>

<p>“How does the refined silver go to Christiania?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“In a country cart,” was the reply, “driven by
a simple bonder.” Even Queen Victoria’s baby-plate
might pass in this manner through the country
without danger of spoliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>No specimens are permitted to be sold in the
mine; the men, I understand, are searched each
time that they leave work.</p>

<p>The fortunes of these celebrated silver mines,
which were discovered in 1623, have been like the
mines themselves. There have been many ups and
downs in them. At one time they have been
worked by the State; at another, they have been
in private hands; and sometimes the exploration
stopped altogether. After thus lying idle for some
years, the works were, in 1814, if I am rightly informed,
offered for sale by the Danish Government
to our present consul-general at Christiania, and the
purchase was only not completed in consequence of
that gentleman declining to keep up the full amount
of workmen, a condition which the Government insisted
on. Be this as it may, they were set a-going
by the Government in 1816, and the Storthing voted
21,000 dollars for the purpose, and even greater
sums in subsequent years. And yet, in 1830, the
mine was not a paying concern. Just about this
time, however, the miners hit upon a rich vein, and
ever since 1832 it has paid. The greatest yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
was in 1833, when about 47,000 marks of pure
silver were obtained. At present, about 400 marks
are obtained weekly, or about 21,000 per annum.
There is an actual profit of nearly 200,000 dollars
a year. Notwithstanding this brilliant state of
affairs, there has, reckoning from first to last, been
a loss of several millions of dollars on the venture.</p>

<p>At one time Kongsberg was a city of considerable
importance. At present, there are less than
5000 inhabitants; but in 1769, when Christiania
had only 7496 inhabitants, Trondjem 7478, and
Bergen 13,735, Kongsberg had over 8000. But
it must be always considered important, as being
the great mining school of the country&mdash;a country
which contains, no doubt, vast mineral treasures
under its surface.</p>

<p>Tough work it was ascending the ladders, and
very hot withal. But as I intended to be in Drammen
that evening, distant five-and-twenty miles, no
time was to be lost. My climbing on the fjeld had
been capital practice; and such was the pace at
which I ascended, that the superintendent, who
joined us, broke down or bolted midway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>We were soon at Kongsberg, it being down hill
all the way. People told me I must by no means
omit going to see a monument on the hill, between
the mines and the town, where the names of ten
kings, who had come to see the mine, were recorded,
including Bernadotte. But I preferred devoting
the rest of my spare time to what I considered
much more instructive, viz., a visit to the establishments
for reducing and refining the silver ore. As
good luck would have it, I had an opportunity of
witnessing the process for refining silver. About
2000l. worth of the precious metal was in an oven,
with a moveable bottom, undergoing the process of
refinement by the intense heat of a pine-wood fire,
blown upon it from above.</p>

<p>Schiller’s magnificent “Song of the Bell” rose to
my mind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>The mynte-mester, a fat man, of grave aspect,
illuminated by large spectacles, ordered one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the Cyclopses around to put what looked like
a thin, long poker, with a small knob at the end,
into the boiling mass. It came out coated with a
smooth envelope of dead metal. This the director
examined, and shook his head; so away went the
blow-pipe as before. Presently the same process
was repeated. On the poker-knob being inserted a
third time, the director scrutinized it carefully, and
then said, “færdig!” On examining it, I found
projecting, like a crown of airy thorns, a coating of
exceedingly fine spicula of frosted silver. That was
the signal that it was sufficiently purified. Never
till now had I known so exactly the force of the
words of the Psalmist, “Even as silver which from the
earth is tried and purified seven times in the fire.”</p>

<p>It was desired to have the silver in small nodules
for silversmiths, as more easily workable than in a
lump. For this purpose, a vessel of cold water
was placed under the furnace-spout. Another
Cyclops stationed himself in front of the said
spout, holding in his hand the nozzle of some
hose connected with a water-engine. With this
he took aim at the orifice (reminding me much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a Norskman shooting game sitting, but in this case
it was flying, as will be seen). A signal is given, a
cock turned, and out rushes the white-hot molten
metal; but at the moment of its escape from the
trap, the fireman discharges a jet of cold water at
it; the consequence is, that, instead of descending in
a continuous stream, the blazing jet is squandered,
and falls into the vessel below in a shower of silver
drops. Danaë could have explained the thing to
a nicety, only her shower was one of gold; while
the metal most predominant in her own composition
would seem to have been brass.</p>

<p>The gentleman who had been conversing with
me in German, and apparently considered me a
Teuton, said he could talk French also; but as for
that horrid English, those people began a sentence
and rolled it in their mouths, spit it half out, and
the rest they swallowed. I strongly recommend
any Englishman, who wishes to hear what people
on the Continent think of John Bull and his wife,
not to betray his nation if he can help it, and then
he has some chance of getting at the true state of
opinion without flattery. This rule will apply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
general society, such as one meets abroad. But
there is a no less golden exception, which is this:
never at a custom-house or police-office know the
language of the officials; if you do, they are sure to
badger you, especially if you are above suspicion.
If, on the other hand, you shrug your shoulders,
and keep replying to their remarks in English, you
will completely foil their efforts at annoyance, and
they will not be able to make anything of you, and
look out for other prey.</p>

<p>Another remarkably polite and intelligent official
now proceeded to show me some beautiful specimens
of pure silver in another part of the building.
Some of these “Handstene,” as they are called, I
purchased. Here, too, were those splendid specimens
that appeared at the Great Exhibition in
London, and also in Paris; and gained a medal in
both instances. The bronze medal, designed by
Wyon, with the busts of Victoria and Albert, and
likewise the silver one of Napoleon, were side by
side; the latter pretty, doubtless, but, to my thinking,
and also that of the inspector, vastly inferior to
the former, which, he said, was a real work of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>My companions at dinner were the engineer of
the new road out of Kongsberg, and a Hungarian
refugee, getting his living by portrait-painting.
All things considered, I should think that the
engineer’s trade was the better of the two. But the
artist was a good-looking fellow, and twirled his
moustache with great complacency; so that,
perhaps, he got sitters. At all events, he could
have no competition.</p>

<p>The new road, which avoids some fearful hills, will
soon be finished; and that is the excuse for not
repairing the old one, which was something like
what Holborn Hill would be with all the paving-stones
up.</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon, who has just returned from
his voyage to Spitzbergen and the Arctic regions,
is about to visit Kongsberg in company with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the Royal Princes of Sweden, to-morrow. It is
lucky for the highway surveyors that it is not
the King of Oude. They doubtless would have
been put into the ruts to fill them up, or smelted
in the smelting-houses, or have had to undergo
some other <i>refined</i> process.</p>

<p>Sigur and I parted company at Hougesund;
he proceeding homewards, and I crawling along to
Drammen, by the side of the elv, with the worst
horse I ever drove in Norway. Fortunately, the
road is a dead level, and good. The river abounds
in salmon, which cannot get up higher than
Hougesund.</p>

<p>On the other side of it, I saw several lights,
which I learned were at saw-mills, which are
working night and day. I suppose they are
taking time by the forelock. Hitherto, saw-mills
have been in the hands of a few privileged persons;
but in 1860 the monopoly expires, and anybody
may erect one.</p>

<p>I had been strongly recommended to one Mr.
Dahl. His caravansary I found both comfortable
and reasonable. The St. Halvard steam-boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
which was to convey me next morning to some
station in the Christiania Fjord, started at seven
o’clock, I found, so I requested to be called at a
little before six. The damsel walked into my
bedroom, without any preliminary knock, long
before that hour.</p>

<p>“You’ve come too early,” said I; “the boat does
not start till seven.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but the passengers are accustomed
to assemble on board half an hour before.”</p>

<p>So much for the Norwegian value of time.</p>

<p>At five minutes to seven I found myself on board
the boat, much to the astonishment, no doubt, of
the numerous passengers; who, with the patient
tranquillity of Norwegians, had long ago settled in
their places.</p>

<p>“St. Halvard&mdash;who was St. Halvard?” said I to
a person near me, as we scudded along through
the blue wares, glistening in the morning sun, and
curled by a gentle breeze. He did not know, but he
thought a friend of his on board knew. The friend,
an intelligent young lieutenant in the army, from
Fredrickshall, soon produced a book of Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Munck’s, but the volume made no mention of the
enigmatical personage. Seeing, however, that I
looked over the pages with interest, nothing would
content the young <i>militaire</i> but that I should
retain possession of it; which I accordingly did,
with many thanks. It may be as well to mention,
that there are two Muncks in Norway; A. Munck,
the poet, and Professor A. P. Munck, the historian,
a person of European reputation, who is now
engaged on a comprehensive work, “Norske Folks
Historie,” “History of the Norsk People.” He is
also author of several other works of antiquarian
research.</p>

<p>“You have been in Thelemarken?” inquired
the lieutenant. “That’s the county for old Norsk
customs and language. With all their dirt and rude
appearance, some of the bonders are very rich, and
proud of their wealth. I remember being at a farm
some miles above Kongsberg, where I saw a number of
copper kettles ranged on a shelf, as bright as
bright could be; I found that these were the
gauge of the bonder’s wealth. For every thousand
dollars saved a new copper kettle was added. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
have no idea how tenacious these people are of
their social position. When the son and daughter
of two bonders are about to be married, a wonderful
deal of diplomacy is used, the one endeavouring
to outwit the other. It is surprising
with all the chaffering and bargaining between
the elders that the marriages turn out so well as
they do.</p>

<p>“And yet even the wealthiest of them live in the
meanest manner. I don’t suppose you would
get any fresh milk in your travels in Thelemarken,
except at the sæters. You would not believe it,
but they are in the habit of keeping their milk
from spring to autumn. To prevent it becoming
stale or maggoty, they stir it every day. In
process of time it assumes a very strong scent,
which the people inhale with great gusto. It is a
filthy affair: but people accustomed to it like it,
I am told, above all things. A curious case in
point occurs to my mind: A Voged, who had
been for some years stationed up in a wild part
of Thelemarken, was translated to Drammen,
which is an agreeable place, and by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
deficient in good society. But, with all this
improvement in neighbourhood, and the appliances
of life; in spite of his increased pay and
higher position, the Voged sickened and pined;
in short, became a regular invalid. What could
it be? He missed the thick, stinking milk of the
Thelemarken wilds. He petitioned to return to
the old Fogderie, where he would have less pay,
but more milk; and, from the last accounts, he
is fully restored to health, and enjoying himself
amazingly.”</p>

<p>As we approached Horten, the chief naval
station of Norway, I saw a new church, apparently
built in red stone, and in the Gothic style;
which, as far as I could judge, reflected no little
credit on the architect. At this moment, a Norskman
tapped me on the shoulder, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>“Are you an Englishman? Do you live in
London? Have you seen the great ship that is
building on the banks of the Thames? They
say it is twice as long as the magazine at Horten
yonder; but I can’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“You mean the <i>Great Eastern</i>, as they call it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
I don’t know how long the magazine is; but the
ship is 680 feet long.”</p>

<p>“Vinkelig! det er accurat dobbelt.” (Really!
then it is exactly double, just as I heard.)</p>

<p>The daily steamer from Christiania to Fredrickshall
met us here, <i>Halden</i>, by name; and separated
me from the intelligent lieutenant, with
whom I exchanged cards.</p>

<p>As we steamed out of Horten, past the gun-boats
and arsenals, a naval-looking man said&mdash;</p>

<p>“We have had a great man here lately, sir:
the Russian Admiral G&mdash;&mdash;. The newspapers
were strongly against his being allowed to pry
about our naval station; but he was permitted by
the Government. After examining everything
very accurately, he said, ‘It’s all very good, too
good: for England will come and take it away
from you.’”</p>

<p>“And what did the dockyard people think of
that? Did they agree with him?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forefend! They knew whom they had
to deal with. As he walked through the arsenal,
he saw some shells lying about. ‘What is that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
some new invention?’ ‘Oh! no,’ said the
officer; ‘it is only shells, after the old fashion.’
The Russian admiral seemed contented with the
reply; but he was not going to be put off the
real scent by a feint of this kind. In fact, a
Norwegian captain, not long ago, did invent a
peculiar kind of shell, which, with unerring precision,
can be so managed as to burst in a vessel’s
side after effecting an entrance. The Russian
knew this, but kept his counsel then. Subsequently,
he found an opportunity of drawing
a subaltern officer aside, to whom he offered two
hundred dollars to reveal the secret. But the
Norskman would not divulge the secret (shell out),
only telling his superior, who took no notice,
but merely chuckled at the Russian’s duplicity.”</p>

<p>“It is an old Russian trick, that,” replied I;
“if I remember rightly, the Muscovites obtained
the secret of the Congreve rocket by some such
underhand manœuvre.”</p>

<p>The admiral’s curiosity will remind the reader of
the facetious <i>Punch’s</i> “Constantine Paul Pry,” who
visited England and France for a similar object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>As we steered down the vast Fjord, which is
here of great width, and ramifies into various
arms, we see the <i>Nornen</i>, a new Norsk frigate, in
the offing, on her trial trip.</p>

<p>A little after noon, we were steaming down a
shallow bay, surrounded by low wooded islets, to
Tönsberg, the most ancient town in Norway.
The harbour for shipping is in the Tönsberg
Fjord, distant a bowshot from where we land;
but to get there by water would require a detour
of several miles. The isthmus is low and flat,
and presents no engineering difficulties whatever.
In any other country, a ship canal would long
since have joined the two waters. At present,
there is only a ditch between.</p>

<p>The ruins of the old fortified castle are still
discernible on the elevation to the north of the
town; and a sort of wooden building, something
between a summer-house and an observatory, has
lately been erected on the spot. The old castle
(Tonsberg-hus) suffered a good deal from an attack
of the Swedes in 1503; and was totally destroyed
in 1532, in the disturbances that ensued on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
return of King Christian II. to Norway. As
early as the close of the ninth century, the city
was a place of resort for merchants, and the
residence of the kings in the middle ages. At
one time there were half a score of churches in
the place; but of these none remained fifty years
ago, except one very ancient one, in the Pointed
style; but this was pulled down by some Vandal
authorities of the place. During the troubles of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries the town was taken
and plundered more than once; but it received
its finishing blow from the Union of Calmar.</p>

<p>An eminence to the east of the town is called
the Mollehaug, where in the middle ages the renowned
Hougathing, or Parliament, was held, and
the kings received homage. There being nothing
left in the town to indicate its former importance,
I mounted up the Castle-hill, and took a look of
the surrounding country and Fjords, with the
blue mountains of Thelemarken far in the distance.
The ancient seat of the Counts of Jarlsberg is near
at hand; from which family the surrounding district
bears the name of Grefskabet (county).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards I strolled into the cemetery. Some of
the tombs were of polished red granite, which is
obtained in the neighbourhood; most of them had
long inscriptions. Under two relievo busts in
white marble was the short motto, “Vi sees igien,”
(we shall meet again,) and then a couple of joined
hands, and the names of So-and-so and his Hustru
(gudewife). On an obelisk of iron I read&mdash;“Underneath
rests the dust of the upright and active
burgher, the tender and true man and father,
merchant Hans Falkenborg. His fellow-burghers’
esteem, his survivors’ tears, testify to his worth.
But the Lord gave, the Lord took. Blessed be
the name of the Lord.” On another stone was
written&mdash;“Underneath reposes the dust of the in-life-and-death-united
friends, Skipper F. and Merchant
B. Both were called from the circle of their
dear friends December 10, 1850, at the age of 28.
Short was their pilgrimage here on earth; but
who hath known the mind of the Lord, who hath
been his councillor? Peace be with their dust.”
Altogether there was much good taste exemplified
in these memorials of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>As I returned towards the inn, I called at the
only bookseller’s in this town of nearly three thousand
inhabitants, in hopes of obtaining some local
literature in reference to a place of such historical
celebrity; Madame Nielsen, however, only sold
school-books of the paltriest description. After
my walk, I was by no means sorry to sit down to a
good dinner at the inn. Opposite me sat a fine
old fellow, with grey streaming locks, while
two bagmen and the host completed the company.
Under the influence of some tolerable Bordeaux,
the old gentleman became quite communicative;
he had been in arms in ’14, when
Norway was separated from Denmark, and the
Norskmen recalcitrated against the cool handing
them over from one Power to another.</p>

<p>“That was a perilous time for us; one false
step, and we might have been undone; but each
man had only one thought, and that was for his
country. In this strait,” continued he, his eyes
sparkling, “one hundred Norskmen met at Eidsvold
on May 1, and on May 17 the constitution
was drawn up which we now enjoy. Please God
it may last. The Norwegians may well be proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
of it, and no wonder that the Swedes are jealous
of us with their four estates, and their miserable
pretence of a constitution&mdash;the worst in Europe.
Their shoals of nobility are the drag-chain; we got
rid of them here in 1821. That was a great blessing;
Carl Johann was against it, and three thousand
Swedish soldiers were in the vicinity of Christiania.
Count Jarlsberg, our chief noble, was for the abolition;
its chief opponent was Falsing. He said in
the Storthing, that if our nobility were abolished
he would say farewell to Norway. Another member
took him up short, and said, ‘And the Norsk hills
would echo well.’”</p>

<p>Dinner over, I drove through the woods back to
Vallö, where I was to meet the steamer. Two
Swiss gentlemen possess a large establishment
here for the manufacture of salt by the evaporation
of salt water; a cotton mill is also adjoining, belonging
to the same proprietors.</p>

<p>On applying for my ticket at the office&mdash;where
it may be had a trifle cheaper than on board&mdash;my
passport is demanded and examined, and the
office-keeper informs me that it is against the rules
to give a ticket for an outward-bound steamer to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
one whose passport has not been countersigned
by the Norwegian authorities. Now, on leaving
Norway by way of Christiania, as I was aware, it is
required to be shown to the police, and <i>viséd</i>, but
as I had never been near the capital this year, and,
from the moment I had landed to this, the passport
had never been demanded, it did not occur
to me that a <i>visé</i> would be required. For the
moment I was disconcerted, as nobody was to be
found at Vallö who could remedy the defect.</p>

<p>On inquiry, however, I found that the naval
officer in command of the coming vessel was my
old friend Captain H., and so I felt secure. There
were plenty of faces that I knew on board, among
the rest some Oxford Undergraduates returning
from a delightful excursion up the country; there
were also some “Old Norwegians,” who had been
fishing in the north, and complained loudly of the
unfavourableness of the season. There had been
an unusual amount of rain and cold, and the rivers
had been so full of snow-water, that the salmon
had stuck at the mouths, a prey to nets, &amp;c.,
in preference to braving the chills of the Elv.</p>

<p>Among other small talk, I began to recount as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
sat in the Captain’s room, how I had seen the old
gentleman with the star and diplomatic coat. (See
<i>antè</i>). Just then somebody came and called out
the first lieutenant by name, which was, I perceived,
the very same as that of the last baron whom I
was engaged in taking off.</p>

<p>“Is he any relation?” I inquired in alarm.</p>

<p>“Only his son,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had not said anything derogatory
to the papa, or I might have placed myself in an
awkward fix. This is only another proof how
cautious you ought to be on board one of these
steamers of talking about whom you have seen,
and what you think, for the coast being the great
high road, everybody of condition takes that route&mdash;you
may have been, perhaps, for instance,
abusing some merchant for overcharges&mdash;and
after speaking your mind, <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i>, the gentleman
with whom you are conversing may surprise
you with a&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ja so! Indeed! That’s my own brother.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever up beyond the North Cape?”
said a Frenchman to me, at dinner.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; I once went to Vadsö.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what sort of beings are they up there?
Half civilized, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not only half, but altogether, I assure you,”
said I. “I met with as much intelligence, and
more real courtesy and kindness, than you will
encounter half the world over.” At this moment
my neighbour to the left, a punchy, good-humoured-looking
little fellow, with a very large
beard and moustache, which covered most of his
face, and who had evidently overheard the conversation,
said, in English:</p>

<p>“You not remember me? You blow out your
eyes with gunpowder upon the banks of the
Neiden. What a malheur it was! Lucky you
did not be blind. I am Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the doctor at
Vadsö. We went, you know, on a pic-nic up the
Varanger Fjord. Count R&mdash;&mdash;, the bear-shooter,
who was such a tippler, was one of the party.”</p>

<p>“Opvarter (waiter), bring me a bottle of port,
first quality, strax (directly),” said I, remembering
the little gentleman perfectly well, and how
kindly he and his companions had on that
occasion drunk skall to the Englishman, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
made me partake of the flowing bowl. We
had a long chat, and presently he introduced
me to his wife; who, I found, was, like himself,
a Dane. They were journeying to their native
country, after several years’ absence.</p>

<p>“What are those Roman Catholics doing up
in Finmark?” said I.</p>

<p>“The people hardly know yet what to make
of them,” he replied. “The supposition generally
is, no doubt, that they wish to convert the
Fins. But I don’t think so. They are aiming
at higher game.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Russia!&mdash;That’s their object. They can’t
get into that country itself. But a vast quantity
of Russians are continually passing and repassing
between the nearest part of Russia and Finmark.
And they will try to indoctrinate them. Their
<i>point d’appui</i> is most dexterously selected. There
is no lack of funds, I assure you. They have
settled on an estate at Alten, which they have
bought.”</p>

<p>“And so clever and agreeable they are,” put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the Dane’s lady. “Mr. Bernard especially. He
has a wonderfully winning manner about him.”</p>

<p>“The chief of the mission,” continued the
doctor, “is M. Etienne, a Russian by birth, whose
real name is Djunkovsky, and who has become
a convert from the Greek faith. He is styled
M. le Préfet Apostolique des Missions Polàires
du Nord, de l’Amerique, &amp;c.; and proposes, he
says, to operate hereafter on parts of North
America. On St. Olaf’s day, he invited forty of
the most respectable people in the neighbourhood
to a banquet, and, in a speech which he made, said
that the Norsk religion had much similarity with
the Roman Catholic; and that Saint Olaf was the
greatest of Norsk kings. Still, I think they have
higher game in view than Norway.”</p>

<p>A master-stroke of policy, thought I. The
Propaganda will have surpassed itself if it should
succeed in setting these people thinking. The
children of the autocrat will cast off their leading-strings
yet; and the strife between the Latin
and Greek Church rage, not between the monks
at the Holy City, but in the heart of holy
Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>At this pause in the conversation, the Frenchman,
who did not seem a whit disconcerted at his
former <i>faux pas</i>, recommenced his criticisms. The
fare, and the doings on board generally, evidently
did not jump with his humour. “What is this
composition?” he inquired of the steward. “Miös-Ost?”
(a sort of goat’s-milk cheese, the size
and shape of a brick, and the colour of hare-soup).
“It’s very sweet,” observed the Frenchman,
sarcastically; “is there any sugar in it?”</p>

<p>“No!” thundered the captain, who did not
seem to relish these strictures. “No. It’s made
of good Norsk milk, and that is so sweet that
no sugar is required.”</p>

<p>This remark had the effect of making the
Gaul look small, and he gulped down any further
satire that he might have had on his tongue.</p>

<p>I heard, by-the-bye, an amusing anecdote of
these cheeses. They are considered a delicacy
in Norway; and a merchant of Christiania sent
one as a present to a friend in England. The
British custom-house authorities took it for a lump
of diachylon, and charged it accordingly, as drugs,
a great deal more than it was worth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>As we sail through the Great Belt, the mast-tops
of a wrecked vessel appear sticking out of
the water near the lighthouse of Lessö. It has
been a case of collision, that dreadful species
of accident that threatens to be more fatal to
modern navies than storms and tempests. In
this case, the schooner seemed determined to
run against something, so she actually ran
against the lighthouse, in a still night, and
when the light was plain to see. The concussion
was so great, that the vessel sank a
few yards off, with some of her crew. The
lighthouse rock is in <i>statu quo</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>On board was Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, a chamberlain at
the Court of Stockholm. This gay gentleman
professed to be terribly smitten by the charms
of a Danish lady, and wished very much to know
whether she was married. I heard that she was,
but she apparently desired to relieve the monotony
of the voyage by a little flirtation, and kept
her secret. On awaking from a nap on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of the sofas, a friend informed me that the
chamberlain, whom I saw sketching a dozing
passenger, had done the like by me. I quietly
got out my sketch-book, and took him off as
quickly as possible. Happening to look my way,
he saw what was going on, and sprang up, as if
shot. “Those who live in glass houses,” &amp;c.
I begged him to look at the caricature I had
made;&mdash;eyes staring out of head, hair brushed
up, &amp;c. This counterfeit presentment seemed
to strike him all of a heap; he shut up his
sketch-book, and walked out of the cabin; while
a Swedish Countess, very young and pretty, who
had been smoking a very strong cigar on deck, and
had to abide the consequences of her rashness,
came downstairs, and took refuge in the ladies’
apartment.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="larger">THE OXONIAN IN NORWAY;</span><br />
Or, Notes of Excursions in that Country.</p>

<p class="center">BY THE REV. F. METCALFE, M.A.,<br />
Fellow of Lincoln College.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">From the Spectator.</span>&mdash;“By far the best book of general travels that we have
met with on this section of Scandinavia. Part of the excellence arises from the
length of time devoted to the subject and pursuits of the author. A persevering
angler, he penetrated fiord, lake, and river; a plucky sportsman, he clomb mountains
and threaded marsh and forest in search of game. These pursuits, too,
forced him into connexion with the peasantry and farmers, with whom a knowledge
of the language enabled the traveller to make himself at home. His Oxford
character gave him a standing in more civilized places&mdash;towns and steamers.
Mr. Metcalfe possesses an eye for the beauty of scenery, and the peculiarities of
men. He has also an easy, off-hand, and lively English style. The reader will
find the <i>Oxonian in Norway</i> a very agreeable companion.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Morning Chronicle.</span>&mdash;“<i>The Oxonian in Norway</i> is replete with
interest, is written in an animated style, and is one of those books which cannot
fail to be at the same time amusing and instructive. Mr. Metcalfe visited places
where an Englishman was a rarity; and all who take an interest in customs practised
by various peoples, will welcome his book for the accounts of Norwegian
manners and customs which have not been touched upon before. Numerous
interesting and exciting anecdotes, in connexion with the author’s excursions in
pursuit of fishing and shooting, pervade throughout.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From Blackwood’s Magazine.</span>&mdash;“Mr. Metcalfe’s book is as full of facts and
interesting information as it can hold, and is interlarded with racy anecdotes.
Some of these are highly original and entertaining. More than this, it is a truly
valuable work, containing a fund of information on the statistics, politics, and
religion of the countries visited.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Daily News.</span>&mdash;“We have seldom met with a more readable record
of sporting reminiscences. The sketches of life and scenery are also vigorous
and characteristic. We recommend these volumes to all lovers of sport. There
is a vast amount of information in them, conveyed in a pleasant form.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Morning Herald.</span>&mdash;“We welcome the second edition of this truly
interesting work with great pleasure. It will prove a useful handbook to those
who contemplate a similar excursion, whilst people who remain at home will
scarcely find a better book from which to obtain useful and interesting information
concerning the country and its inhabitants.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Athenæum.</span>&mdash;“Mr. Metcalfe went about with much activity both
by land and sea, and a great deal of information is to be found in these volumes.
His matter is good, his style free, candid, and agreeable, and his general tone
manly and genial.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Literary Gazette.</span>&mdash;“These volumes are extremely lively and
entertaining, written in a vein of high animal spirits, and full of details which
bring the country and the people vividly before us.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Press.</span>&mdash;“We have to thank Mr. Metcalfe for a couple of very
amusing volumes. He has made several trips to Norway, and has here given to
the public the fruits of his experience. He is a keen angler, and at the same time
an intelligent observer&mdash;gifted with excellent powers of description and a quick
perception of humour. Hence his notices of Norwegian scenery and of the manners
and social state of the people are of a kind to attract all classes of readers.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lodge’s Peerage and Baronetage</span> is acknowledged to be
the most complete, as well as the most elegant, work of the kind
that has ever appeared. As an established and authentic authority
on all questions respecting the family histories, honours, and connexions
of the titled aristocracy, no work has ever stood so high.
It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and
His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, and is annually corrected
throughout, from the personal communications of the Nobility.
It is the only work of its class in which, <i>the type being kept constantly
standing</i>, every correction is made in its proper place to the
date of publication, an advantage which gives it supremacy over all
its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic information
respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most
sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral branches of
the various noble families, and the names of many thousand
individuals are introduced, which do not appear in other records of the
titled classes. Nothing can exceed the facility of its arrangements,
or the beauty of its typography and binding, and for its authority,
correctness and embellishments, the work is justly entitled to the
high place it occupies on the tables of Her Majesty and the Nobility.</p>

<p>“A work which corrects all errors of former works. It is the production of a herald, we

<p>“The production of Edmund Lodge, Esq., Norroy King of Arms, whose splendid Biography
of Illustrious Personages stands an unrivalled specimen of historical literature, and
magnificent illustration. Of Mr. Lodge’s talent for the task he has undertaken, we need

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
